2
00:01:09,704 --> 00:01:12,743
Based on a true story.

3
00:01:13,353 --> 00:01:18,361
1953 Enmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay became
the first climbers to summit of Everest.

4
00:01:18,461 --> 00:01:23,356
Over the next 40 years. Only professional
climbers attempted the same feat.

5
00:01:23,381 --> 00:01:26,259
One in four died

6
00:01:26,456 --> 00:01:30,173
1992 New Zealander, Rob Hall pioneered the concept of
commercial guiding on Everest for amateur climbers.

7
00:01:30,352 --> 00:01:34,054
Over the next four years, his team, Adventure
Consultants, successfully led 19 clients to the summit

8
00:01:34,133 --> 00:01:36,643
without a single fatality.

9
00:01:36,994 --> 00:01:42,130
1996 Other commercial operators follow Rob Hall's
lead, including Scott Fischer's Mountain Madness.

10
00:01:42,309 --> 00:01:47,421
More than 20 expeditions compete to summit
Everest in the same two week window.

11
00:01:48,905 --> 00:01:50,601
Please listen up.

12
00:01:51,382 --> 00:01:52,999
Guys.

13
00:01:53,827 --> 00:01:56,118
We got 2000 feet (ft),

14
00:01:56,143 --> 00:01:58,274
600 vertical metres (m)

15
00:01:58,307 --> 00:02:00,411
to Camp 4.

16
00:02:00,436 --> 00:02:02,644
Let's rope all the way,

17
00:02:02,669 --> 00:02:04,782
so I know you can make it.

18
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:08,239
Alright, once we get to the
Yellow band, we're going to regroup.

19
00:02:08,264 --> 00:02:11,072
Put on the mask,
turn on the gas.

20
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:12,805
Make sense?

21
00:03:04,611 --> 00:03:06,586
$325 a bottle,

22
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:07,520
for oxygen. (6 weeks ago...)

23
00:03:07,544 --> 00:03:09,604
It's daylight robbery.
(6 weeks ago...)

24
00:03:09,633 --> 00:03:11,651
Yeah. Well, he's cornered
the market, he's got it.

25
00:03:11,676 --> 00:03:14,882
He reckon there's going to be
20 teams at Base camp this season.

26
00:03:14,907 --> 00:03:15,960
20 teams?

27
00:03:15,985 --> 00:03:17,476
I mean with all the
Sherpas and porters

28
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:19,680
it's going to be
squeeze up there.

29
00:03:20,138 --> 00:03:22,906
Lets...
scrum on the ropes right there.

30
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:24,023
What is this?

31
00:03:24,048 --> 00:03:25,171
It's Helen's.

32
00:03:25,196 --> 00:03:27,073
It's a little decoration
for the mess in.

33
00:03:27,098 --> 00:03:28,467
Hey, you can wear them
on your head, y'hear.

34
00:03:28,493 --> 00:03:29,350
I'll have it, thank you.

35
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,658
Okay, I got some news.

36
00:03:31,938 --> 00:03:33,158
- We got Krakauer.
- Huh?

37
00:03:33,183 --> 00:03:34,265
Oh, yeah!

38
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,803
- You stole him from Scott Fischer.
- No, he made his own mind.

39
00:03:36,828 --> 00:03:38,680
Good job, Rob.

40
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,894
How much is he paying you, Rob?

41
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:44,178
Well, he's...
only paying for his airfare.

42
00:03:44,203 --> 00:03:46,091
But we got 5000 words

43
00:03:46,116 --> 00:03:49,065
in the magazine and our picture
in the front cover. Huh.

44
00:03:49,114 --> 00:03:51,831
That makes it all worthwhile.
Right there.

45
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,310
Or if you get him to the top.

46
00:03:53,335 --> 00:03:56,294
If... If...
How can you say that to me?

47
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,400
- There you go.
- I got you.

48
00:03:57,417 --> 00:03:59,156
You alright? Thanks, Guy.
Cheers, mate.

49
00:03:59,188 --> 00:04:01,437
- Hey.
- Hi, Rob.

50
00:04:01,672 --> 00:04:04,249
- Good to see you.
- Oh, yeah. How are you?

51
00:04:04,274 --> 00:04:07,103
- I am good. Oh, look at you.
- I know.

52
00:04:07,128 --> 00:04:08,848
- Big.
- Here you go.

53
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:09,836
You good?

54
00:04:09,885 --> 00:04:11,021
- Yeh, you know.
- Okay.

55
00:04:11,046 --> 00:04:12,706
Just going to miss you.

56
00:04:15,801 --> 00:04:17,609
Let's go, Guy.

57
00:04:18,127 --> 00:04:21,015
Just-Just go careful, alright?

58
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,758
- It's just...
- Please don't.

59
00:04:22,783 --> 00:04:25,039
Come on, please don't worry.

60
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:27,734
It's just that doing nothing back here
that's making me worry.

61
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,450
- You're not doing nothing.
- No, but...

62
00:04:30,664 --> 00:04:32,091
What?

63
00:04:32,385 --> 00:04:34,703
It's the waiting for you.

64
00:04:34,728 --> 00:04:37,012
- For him.
- Ha ha.

65
00:04:37,037 --> 00:04:39,012
- Her.
- Her.

66
00:04:41,276 --> 00:04:44,685
Just, be back for the birth,
Rob Hall.

67
00:04:45,412 --> 00:04:47,754
You try and stop me.

68
00:04:51,831 --> 00:04:54,451
- Okay, I love you.
- Go, or I'll cry.

69
00:04:54,476 --> 00:04:56,017
Go.

70
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:16,913
KATHMANDU, NEPAL

71
00:05:18,349 --> 00:05:20,056
March 30th 1996.

72
00:05:20,081 --> 00:05:21,581
Here.

73
00:05:21,606 --> 00:05:24,332
- That all you got.
- Yeah. That's it.

74
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,651
I think we're over here.

75
00:05:34,905 --> 00:05:37,510
Hey...
What work outfit you guys with?

76
00:05:37,535 --> 00:05:40,122
- Adventure Consultants.
- Uh, good, me too.

77
00:05:40,147 --> 00:05:41,739
I'm Beck. Beck Weathers.

78
00:05:41,764 --> 00:05:43,227
Doug Hansen.

79
00:05:43,252 --> 00:05:45,034
- Jon Krakauer.
- How're you doing?

80
00:05:45,059 --> 00:05:46,445
- Okay.
- Are you...

81
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,649
Krakauer from Outside magazine.

82
00:05:48,674 --> 00:05:50,337
- Yeah.
- Really?

83
00:05:50,362 --> 00:05:52,528
What're you doing?
Writing or climbing or what?

84
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:54,492
A little bit of both.

85
00:05:54,942 --> 00:05:57,620
Well. I'll let you know
how the Summit goes, okay?

86
00:05:57,645 --> 00:06:01,087
- No need, I'll be there.
- We'll see.

87
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:19,011
What do you do when
you're not climbing, Doug?

88
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,907
- What? Work?
- Yeah.

89
00:06:20,932 --> 00:06:23,872
Uh, different things.
Carpenter. Mailman.

90
00:06:23,897 --> 00:06:26,768
- Carpenter. Mailman.
- Yep.

91
00:06:26,793 --> 00:06:30,691
- Seriously, you deliver the mail?
- Yep, I deliver the mail.

92
00:06:31,384 --> 00:06:33,647
Mailman on Everest?

93
00:06:33,672 --> 00:06:36,418
- Hope so.
- Ha ha. I like that.

94
00:06:36,443 --> 00:06:38,534
Mailman on Everest.

95
00:06:46,302 --> 00:06:47,574
There we go.

96
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:49,072
- Beck.
- Yeah.

97
00:06:49,097 --> 00:06:51,393
You know, he made it to the
South Summit on Everest last year.

98
00:06:51,418 --> 00:06:53,604
- Who? Doug did?
- Yeah.

99
00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:57,225
- That's pretty hot for a mailman.
- Yep.

100
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,715
Brown's Peak, McKinley.

101
00:06:59,762 --> 00:07:02,630
I never made it up to
the top of McKinley myself.

102
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,682
I know.

103
00:07:03,707 --> 00:07:06,485
- How did you know that?
- 89', right?

104
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,607
Ohhh. You done your research.

105
00:07:09,632 --> 00:07:11,490
That's what we do.

106
00:07:17,215 --> 00:07:19,142
GARUDA HOTEL

107
00:07:19,267 --> 00:07:22,759
You, my friends, are following
in some very famous footsteps.

108
00:07:22,784 --> 00:07:24,977
A history made famous
by George Everest,

109
00:07:25,002 --> 00:07:28,022
George Mallory, Tenzing Norgay,
Edmund Hillary...

110
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:29,162
- And Rob Hall.
- Lege...

111
00:07:29,187 --> 00:07:31,192
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

112
00:07:31,248 --> 00:07:33,568
Legend... lege...
legends, all of them.

113
00:07:33,593 --> 00:07:35,492
- Ha-ha-ha...
- Eh ha ha...

114
00:07:35,517 --> 00:07:37,213
That's right.

115
00:07:37,501 --> 00:07:39,275
For those of you who dare
face the dreams,

116
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,992
Adventure Consultants offer something
beyond the power of words to describe.

117
00:07:44,017 --> 00:07:46,803
And why don't we
describe it in the brochure.

118
00:07:48,153 --> 00:07:50,578
Because it's mostly just pain.

119
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:51,885
- Yes.
- Ain't that the truth.

120
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:53,642
And the odd,
if you don't mind, Mike.

121
00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:56,447
And the odd missing toe.

122
00:07:57,163 --> 00:07:58,319
There we go.

123
00:07:58,344 --> 00:07:59,670
- Oh.
- Ooo.

124
00:07:59,695 --> 00:08:01,491
To put it simply, guys.

125
00:08:01,516 --> 00:08:04,456
Human beings
simply aren't built to function

126
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:08,423
at the cruising altitude of a 747.

127
00:08:08,641 --> 00:08:12,037
Okay, once we get above here,
above the South Col.

128
00:08:12,062 --> 00:08:15,313
Our bodies will be literally dying
and I mean literally dying.

129
00:08:15,338 --> 00:08:17,493
It's not called the Death Zone
for nothing, guys.

130
00:08:17,518 --> 00:08:20,951
So, the game is,
can we get you up to the top

131
00:08:20,976 --> 00:08:24,449
and down to the bottom
before that happens.

132
00:08:24,474 --> 00:08:27,046
- You sure can.
- Oh.

133
00:08:27,183 --> 00:08:28,510
Beck Weathers,
ladies and gentlemen.

134
00:08:28,535 --> 00:08:30,625
You might've noticed he's a
bit of a lone star state.

135
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:34,954
100% Texan right here, people.
100% Texan.

136
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,350
You met Mike Groom.

137
00:08:37,681 --> 00:08:39,839
I like to introduce you to Andy Harris.
Or Harold.

138
00:08:39,864 --> 00:08:41,421
Harold had got out of Queenstown.

139
00:08:41,446 --> 00:08:43,480
Taranaki actually,
originally Canada.

140
00:08:43,513 --> 00:08:45,646
Helen and the rest of the team are
already on their way up to Base Camp.

141
00:08:45,671 --> 00:08:48,102
They're setting it up
when we get there.

142
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,989
- Today is March 30th, people.
- Yeah.

143
00:08:50,014 --> 00:08:52,209
I plan on going to
the Summit, May 10th.

144
00:08:52,234 --> 00:08:54,472
It's been a lucky day for me
in Adventure Consultants,

145
00:08:54,497 --> 00:08:57,129
and the weather is usually
pretty stable around then.

146
00:08:57,154 --> 00:08:58,474
So that means,

147
00:08:58,499 --> 00:09:02,217
We have 40 days,
to train your bodies and your minds

148
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:03,444
to go for it.

149
00:09:03,468 --> 00:09:06,418
Now. I know there is a lot of
mountaineering experience in this room

150
00:09:06,442 --> 00:09:07,880
you wouldn't be here without it.

151
00:09:07,905 --> 00:09:10,936
- Stu, K2, Broad Peak.
- Nice.

152
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:14,746
John Taske,
1192m of Mount Kosciuszko.

153
00:09:14,771 --> 00:09:16,234
- Ha ha ha...
- Eh ha ha...

154
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:18,682
- And Yasuko Namba.
- Oh.

155
00:09:18,707 --> 00:09:20,066
- 6 of the 7 Summits.
- Yeah.

156
00:09:20,091 --> 00:09:22,106
- An amazing woman.
- There you go.

157
00:09:22,131 --> 00:09:23,754
- Let's make it 7.
- Thank you.

158
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:27,454
But, Everest though, is another beast.
Another beast altogether.

159
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:29,328
That's why you're here.
Isn't that right, Dougy.

160
00:09:29,353 --> 00:09:32,415
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

161
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,980
So, listen.
Tonight, that's it for me.

162
00:09:34,005 --> 00:09:37,610
Eat, drink, be merry.
Tomorrow we trek.

163
00:09:39,782 --> 00:09:41,928
Alright, let's go.

164
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:47,539
Alright, folks, hang on.

165
00:09:47,564 --> 00:09:48,617
Okay.

166
00:09:48,642 --> 00:09:50,085
That's it. Here we go, colonel.

167
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,883
Alright, everybody, earbuds.

168
00:09:51,915 --> 00:09:53,974
Take your seats.
Buckle in, everyone.

169
00:09:53,999 --> 00:09:55,635
Thanks, bud.

170
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,621
Murdock, here we go.

171
00:09:57,646 --> 00:09:59,613
Okay, everybody.

172
00:09:59,998 --> 00:10:02,077
Hey, can you believe it.

173
00:10:24,347 --> 00:10:26,914
Lukla: 9,383 ft 2,860 m.

174
00:10:35,097 --> 00:10:36,448
Take it easy. Nice work.

175
00:10:36,473 --> 00:10:38,037
Take it easy.

176
00:10:38,829 --> 00:10:41,616
- Ready.
- Let's go.

177
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,535
You lead the way.

178
00:10:44,426 --> 00:10:46,551
- Are you alright?
- Come on, man.

179
00:11:19,025 --> 00:11:21,169
NAMCHE BAZAAR: 12,303 ft
3,750 m.

180
00:11:21,194 --> 00:11:23,441
Guys, man want to see
your climbing permits.

181
00:11:23,466 --> 00:11:26,058
Need to see all
your climbing permits.

182
00:11:28,117 --> 00:11:29,623
Thank you very much.
We'll see you on the way back.

183
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:31,331
Thank you very much.

184
00:11:31,356 --> 00:11:33,628
- All good?
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you?

185
00:11:33,653 --> 00:11:35,908
- Yeah.
- Hey...

186
00:11:35,933 --> 00:11:37,560
Thanks, Rob.

187
00:11:38,042 --> 00:11:41,060
- Thanks for what?
- You know, the discount.

188
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:44,428
You're working 3 jobs, Doug.

189
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:45,966
It's the least I can do, right?

190
00:11:45,991 --> 00:11:49,687
I know you didn't have to do it.
I appreciate it.

191
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:52,255
Let's just get you
to the top this time.

192
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,034
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

193
00:11:54,059 --> 00:11:55,683
Yeah.

194
00:12:04,425 --> 00:12:06,293
How're you feeling, Beck?

195
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:08,692
About a third to midland.

196
00:12:08,717 --> 00:12:10,475
Come on, buddy. You can do it.

197
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,792
Thought I was going to
acclimatize faster than this.

198
00:12:12,817 --> 00:12:14,758
Uh. You'll be alright.

199
00:12:17,266 --> 00:12:19,040
Go on, critters.

200
00:12:34,064 --> 00:12:35,672
Woo.

201
00:12:36,676 --> 00:12:38,952
- Well.
- Yeah.

202
00:12:44,207 --> 00:12:45,610
How close did you get?

203
00:12:45,635 --> 00:12:47,477
I got really close, but...

204
00:12:47,502 --> 00:12:50,874
got a lateness,
pretty shot anyways, so...

205
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:54,048
I think I would have
made a run for it.

206
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:56,908
- Everyday I wake up thinking that.
- Then why didn't you do it?

207
00:12:56,933 --> 00:12:59,076
Because I turned him around.

208
00:12:59,222 --> 00:13:00,885
1:15 (PM) of the South Summit.

209
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:04,344
That condition, we weren't going to
make that 2 PM turn around.

210
00:13:04,695 --> 00:13:06,296
It's all good more to make
the top, Beck.

211
00:13:06,306 --> 00:13:08,861
But you pay me
to bring you down safely.

212
00:13:08,886 --> 00:13:10,479
Remember that.

213
00:13:11,564 --> 00:13:13,192
Okay.

214
00:13:22,049 --> 00:13:23,840
What's eating him?

215
00:13:24,609 --> 00:13:27,340
One of those Sherpas is Tenzing.
He had an accident.

216
00:13:27,365 --> 00:13:29,573
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah.

217
00:13:29,598 --> 00:13:31,900
On the icefall.

218
00:13:31,925 --> 00:13:34,788
It's not good,
had to bring him down.

219
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:54,080
TENGOCHE MONASTERY: 12,687 ft
3,867 m.

220
00:14:06,991 --> 00:14:14,991
Blessing at Tengboche Monastery.

221
00:14:16,104 --> 00:14:17,588
Namaste.

222
00:14:21,714 --> 00:14:23,261
Namaste.

223
00:14:26,758 --> 00:14:31,877
THE CLIMBERS' MEMORIALS, THOK LA: 16,000 ft
4,877 metres.

224
00:15:15,218 --> 00:15:18,367
EVEREST BASE CAMP: 17,600 ft
5,367 metres.

225
00:15:19,745 --> 00:15:23,417
Congratulation, you all made it.
Welcome to Base Camp.

226
00:15:23,442 --> 00:15:25,514
It'll be a united nations
here this year.

227
00:15:25,539 --> 00:15:28,445
We've the Allmax teams.
South africans.

228
00:15:30,418 --> 00:15:32,333
And right up here,

229
00:15:33,443 --> 00:15:35,729
in the best spot of all,

230
00:15:36,037 --> 00:15:38,238
we have the Adventure Consultants
Base Camp.

231
00:15:38,263 --> 00:15:39,361
- Hey.
- Hi, Helen.

232
00:15:39,386 --> 00:15:41,098
- Hi, how are you?
- Nice to see you.

233
00:15:41,123 --> 00:15:43,629
- Welcome, nice to see you.
- Thank you.

234
00:15:43,654 --> 00:15:45,133
- Hi, Rob.
- Hey.

235
00:15:45,158 --> 00:15:47,475
- You alright?
- Yeah, yeah, good. You?

236
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,128
- Yeah. You know, we're good.
- Yeah, it looks good.

237
00:15:50,153 --> 00:15:51,415
For those of you that haven't met.

238
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,909
This is Helen Wilton,
Base Camp manager.

239
00:15:53,934 --> 00:15:57,455
She'll be your mom
for the next... few weeks.

240
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,561
Any problems take it to her,
and she'll sort it.

241
00:15:59,586 --> 00:16:00,773
Alright. Um.

242
00:16:00,798 --> 00:16:03,783
Well, it's very nice to finally
meet you all in person.

243
00:16:03,808 --> 00:16:05,288
Ang Dorjee, come here.

244
00:16:05,313 --> 00:16:06,987
This is Ang Dorjee, everyone.

245
00:16:07,012 --> 00:16:10,048
He's you climbing sirdar,
your lead sherpa.

246
00:16:10,073 --> 00:16:11,955
- Hey, how are you?
- Okay.

247
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:15,853
- You... You speak English?
- Better than you, Mr. America.

248
00:16:16,648 --> 00:16:19,549
- Bet you climb better than I do, huh?
- Yeah.

249
00:16:19,663 --> 00:16:21,274
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

250
00:16:21,469 --> 00:16:22,920
Ang summit it 3 times, Beck.

251
00:16:22,945 --> 00:16:24,465
Alright, alright.
I hear you, I hear you.

252
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:26,693
Alright. Well, there's tea
in the mess tin

253
00:16:26,718 --> 00:16:29,141
when you dumped your sacks.
And...

254
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:30,474
The comm's tent down the back.

255
00:16:30,499 --> 00:16:33,108
That's the cooking tent
and over there

256
00:16:33,133 --> 00:16:35,093
- is the toilet.
- All good?

257
00:16:35,302 --> 00:16:38,780
It's a little bit drafty,
but just remember that...

258
00:16:38,805 --> 00:16:40,186
When the wind gets
upheave, you got

259
00:16:40,211 --> 00:16:42,752
the same view as
George Everest did.

260
00:16:50,401 --> 00:16:52,723
For those of you who haven't
used crampons before

261
00:16:52,748 --> 00:16:55,583
left and right are mark
you can't get it wrong.

262
00:16:55,608 --> 00:16:57,153
- Alright, so, simple.
- Okay.

263
00:16:57,178 --> 00:17:00,832
First of all, you push it
into the shoe, like this.

264
00:17:00,857 --> 00:17:02,922
Unbelievable.

265
00:17:02,947 --> 00:17:05,377
If it isn't the
mayor of Base Camp.

266
00:17:05,402 --> 00:17:08,698
Scott Fischer,
Mr. Mountain Madness.

267
00:17:09,368 --> 00:17:10,885
In the flesh.

268
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:12,479
You want a cup?

269
00:17:12,504 --> 00:17:15,689
Sit down, man. Acclimatize.

270
00:17:16,344 --> 00:17:18,972
Okay. I'm normally a
tea man myself, but...

271
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:21,988
- Let's give it a go.
- Thank you so much.

272
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,588
Well, it's crazy this year, aye.

273
00:17:29,976 --> 00:17:31,120
I know, man.

274
00:17:31,145 --> 00:17:33,870
Some idiot kiwi goes and
advance Himalaya guide here.

275
00:17:33,895 --> 00:17:35,975
Look what happens.

276
00:17:36,002 --> 00:17:38,615
Yeah. Didn't take you too long
to get in on the act.

277
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,903
Got to make a living, man.

278
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,986
You... went ahead and
fixed the ice post, I see.

279
00:17:45,011 --> 00:17:47,618
Yeah, yeah.
It's pretty messy up there this year.

280
00:17:47,643 --> 00:17:49,162
- Yeah?
- The vasses are pretty big.

281
00:17:49,187 --> 00:17:51,325
Strung 4 or 5 ladders across.

282
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,446
You use good ropes there, did you?

283
00:17:54,272 --> 00:17:55,628
You ready? Okay.

284
00:17:55,653 --> 00:17:59,082
This is April 7th
about 10:30 am.

285
00:17:59,107 --> 00:18:02,034
This is Sandy Hill Pittman reporting
for Nbc Interactive Media

286
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:05,924
and we are official at
Everest Base Camp.

287
00:18:05,949 --> 00:18:07,852
- She one of yours?
- Oh, yeah.

288
00:18:07,877 --> 00:18:11,735
Someone went and stole my journalist
so I had to get another one.

289
00:18:11,795 --> 00:18:14,538
She's a lot easier on the eye
than Jon Krakauer, that's for sure.

290
00:18:14,563 --> 00:18:16,335
Listen, just to be clear
I didn't steal your journalist.

291
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,736
Hey, man. It's all good.

292
00:18:17,761 --> 00:18:19,922
- Outside magazine gave me a call...
- Hey.

293
00:18:19,947 --> 00:18:21,448
- They gave me a call...
- Hey!

294
00:18:21,473 --> 00:18:23,571
- Said they wanted...
- It's all good.

295
00:18:23,596 --> 00:18:25,194
They're going to sent
a journalist up the hill

296
00:18:25,219 --> 00:18:27,541
and asked me if
I was interested.

297
00:18:28,785 --> 00:18:30,847
It was his call in the end.

298
00:18:41,015 --> 00:18:42,971
Alright.
Carol Mackenzie, team doctor.

299
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,572
Why don't you kick it off, Carol.

300
00:18:44,597 --> 00:18:46,360
- Hi, everyone.
- Hey, Carol.

301
00:18:46,385 --> 00:18:47,844
Hi, there.

302
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:51,872
- Hey, sorry.
- No, it's fine.

303
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:54,496
Um. So...
Rob and Harold and Mike

304
00:18:54,521 --> 00:18:57,161
will tell you all sorts of stuff
about mountaineering.

305
00:18:57,186 --> 00:18:59,399
But, from a medical stand of point,

306
00:18:59,424 --> 00:19:02,851
getting you to the top of Everest
was really about oxygen.

307
00:19:02,876 --> 00:19:04,637
And the lack of it.

308
00:19:04,662 --> 00:19:06,530
To give you the best chance
of summiting,

309
00:19:06,555 --> 00:19:09,874
you need to prepare your bodies
for the thin air up there.

310
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:12,731
So, over the next month
before the final ascend,

311
00:19:12,756 --> 00:19:15,664
you are going to make
3 partial acclimatizing ascends,

312
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:18,786
returning here, to Base Camp,
after each one.

313
00:19:18,811 --> 00:19:23,055
The bad news is that each ascend
begins and ends with the icefall.

314
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,217
I'm sorry,
but there's no way around it.

315
00:19:26,347 --> 00:19:31,122
There're millions of tons of glacier ice
continue moving day and night.

316
00:19:32,706 --> 00:19:36,360
Your crevasses so deep they
probably don't even have a bottom.

317
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:38,811
It is not a place that you want to
get caught hanging out in,

318
00:19:38,836 --> 00:19:40,698
especially when the sun hits it.

319
00:19:40,723 --> 00:19:44,245
So, we're going to be up, nice and early
and through that as soon as possible.

320
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:46,856
Now, the Sherpas are going ahead and
fixed the ladders across the crevasses

321
00:19:46,881 --> 00:19:49,391
and we've made it
as safe as we possibly can.

322
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:52,398
But, that is not to say
that it is completely safe.

323
00:19:52,423 --> 00:19:55,068
19 people have died
in that icefall.

324
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:58,612
- Whoa whoa whoa...
- Hold on.

325
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,744
Steady.

326
00:20:00,769 --> 00:20:03,619
- You alright, Jon?
- You alright?

327
00:20:03,644 --> 00:20:06,948
- I'm good. Okay.
- Alright, steady up.

328
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:09,550
So, remember, we're a team,

329
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:11,510
let's look up for each other.

330
00:20:11,542 --> 00:20:14,237
- Lookout for hypothermia.
(CAMP ONE: 19,500 ft: 5,944 m)

331
00:20:14,262 --> 00:20:17,965
Things like slur speech
and irrational behaviour.

332
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,482
I've seen hypoxia climbers
ripped off all their clothes

333
00:20:20,507 --> 00:20:23,553
at 8000 m because
they are feeling hot.

334
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:27,828
You all know about cerebral edema,
the swelling of your brain

335
00:20:27,868 --> 00:20:32,063
to the point of lost of motor
function and eventually death.

336
00:20:32,677 --> 00:20:35,879
And pulmonary edema, which is
your lungs filling with fluid.

337
00:20:35,904 --> 00:20:38,115
Till you fatally drown.

338
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:41,515
The only cure is to get
down the mountain fast.

339
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,127
- Alright. Okay.
- Alright, buddy.

340
00:20:43,152 --> 00:20:45,608
But, it is not all doom
and gloom here, okay?

341
00:20:45,633 --> 00:20:49,299
Myself and the whole AC team are here
to make sure you get up and down safely

342
00:20:49,324 --> 00:20:52,251
and you will acclimatize naturally.

343
00:20:52,276 --> 00:20:55,188
So, why don't we all,
give Carol a nice big thank you.

344
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:56,745
- Oh, you don't have to give me that.
- It's her first time here.

345
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:58,081
- Hey.
- Alright.

346
00:20:58,106 --> 00:20:59,770
Nice job.

347
00:21:00,533 --> 00:21:03,994
April 23rd.

348
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,866
CAMP TWO: 21,300 ft 6,492 m.

349
00:21:10,497 --> 00:21:12,619
- Well done.
- Have a seat.

350
00:21:12,644 --> 00:21:16,021
You want to get on the regulator
or you want to hear that.

351
00:21:17,575 --> 00:21:18,819
Can you get hosed.

352
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:20,732
- Yasuko.
- Beck.

353
00:21:20,757 --> 00:21:22,433
- How're you doing, darling?
- Okay.

354
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:23,527
- Good?
- Yeah.

355
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:25,166
- Well done.
- Hang in there.

356
00:21:25,191 --> 00:21:27,098
Help yourself with that.

357
00:21:27,123 --> 00:21:29,721
In a situation like this,
you just want to catch your breath

358
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:31,923
go right up to 4, you should
start feeling pretty good.

359
00:21:31,948 --> 00:21:33,148
Yeah, I can feel that already.

360
00:21:33,155 --> 00:21:34,628
How did you boys go?

361
00:21:34,653 --> 00:21:36,211
- Instant happiness.
- Hey.

362
00:21:36,236 --> 00:21:38,961
- Amazing.
- Very happy.

363
00:21:42,143 --> 00:21:44,299
- Doug, you okay?
- Huh?

364
00:21:44,324 --> 00:21:46,786
When we get back to base,
I want you to...

365
00:21:46,811 --> 00:21:48,026
get Carol to get a look at you.

366
00:21:48,051 --> 00:21:49,307
Nah, I'm alright. I'm okay.

367
00:21:49,332 --> 00:21:52,329
Then... do me a favor,
swinge another oxygen.

368
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:53,675
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

369
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,970
- You got enough?
- We got plenty.

370
00:21:55,995 --> 00:21:57,425
Alright.

371
00:21:58,709 --> 00:22:00,581
Get some tea in here.

372
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:03,267
Just lift your shirt up a bit.

373
00:22:03,292 --> 00:22:04,817
Thank you.

374
00:22:07,602 --> 00:22:09,953
Now, take a deep breath for me.

375
00:22:15,857 --> 00:22:17,364
Just take one of those
in the morning

376
00:22:17,389 --> 00:22:18,913
with a little bit of water
before breakfast.

377
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:20,419
Okay. Thanks.

378
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,062
- Right, Beck. You're up.
- Sorry.

379
00:22:22,087 --> 00:22:23,984
Yeah. Go for it.

380
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:27,239
Read it and weep.

381
00:22:27,651 --> 00:22:29,539
Take it easy there.

382
00:22:32,748 --> 00:22:34,382
- Right, you can stop.
- Yeah?

383
00:22:34,407 --> 00:22:36,924
- You're in great shape, Beck.
- I'm in great shape.

384
00:22:36,949 --> 00:22:39,018
- Yeah.
- 6 days a week in the gym

385
00:22:39,043 --> 00:22:41,348
- ought to do it.
- Your wife must have love that.

386
00:22:41,373 --> 00:22:43,346
Yeah, she does.

387
00:22:43,582 --> 00:22:46,059
Oh no. What's the date today?

388
00:22:46,084 --> 00:22:48,566
- April 25th.
- No.

389
00:22:48,591 --> 00:22:50,451
No.

390
00:22:54,478 --> 00:22:57,376
I need to send a message to my wife.
Can I use your fax?

391
00:22:57,401 --> 00:23:00,747
You might want to look at this one first,
came in for you last night.

392
00:23:03,262 --> 00:23:05,344
Happy Anniversary Beck - Peach.

393
00:23:05,369 --> 00:23:06,508
Lord.

394
00:23:06,533 --> 00:23:07,796
What?

395
00:23:08,826 --> 00:23:10,538
Can I-Can I use your satphone?

396
00:23:10,563 --> 00:23:14,107
Woo. Well, if this did come in
last night, it is an emergency.

397
00:23:14,132 --> 00:23:16,821
- It's... 25 bucks a minute, Beck.
- Yeah, fine.

398
00:23:16,846 --> 00:23:19,654
- No. This one is on us.
- Seriously.

399
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,217
Thanks.

400
00:23:22,591 --> 00:23:24,196
Rob.

401
00:23:25,394 --> 00:23:27,900
- Beck?
- Peach, it's me.

402
00:23:27,925 --> 00:23:29,428
What happened?

403
00:23:29,453 --> 00:23:31,554
Nothing. Nothing. I'm fine.

404
00:23:31,579 --> 00:23:33,896
Where-Where are you?

405
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,953
I'm at Base Camp right now.

406
00:23:36,978 --> 00:23:38,972
You're calling me from Everest?

407
00:23:39,007 --> 00:23:40,688
Yeah, it's a satellite phone, honey.

408
00:23:40,713 --> 00:23:42,891
Oh my god.
How much is that costing?

409
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:46,635
- What's the problem?
- There is no problem, Peach.

410
00:23:47,542 --> 00:23:49,482
I'm sorry, we were
up at Camp 2 and

411
00:23:49,507 --> 00:23:52,534
that's why I didn't send
you a fax yesterday.

412
00:23:54,045 --> 00:23:57,421
Happy anniversary. Okay.

413
00:23:57,446 --> 00:23:58,979
- Get off.
- Mom.

414
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:01,602
- How're the kids?
- Fine.

415
00:24:01,627 --> 00:24:03,141
- Hey.
- Peach.

416
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:05,349
- Get off.
- Bud's here.

417
00:24:06,075 --> 00:24:08,965
Doing his homework
in the morning as per usual.

418
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,465
You want to say hi to him?

419
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,775
Yeah, of course I do.

420
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,946
- Hang on.
- Okay.

421
00:24:12,971 --> 00:24:14,006
- Say hi.
- Hey, Dad.

422
00:24:14,031 --> 00:24:15,230
- Hey, Bud.
- Hi.

423
00:24:15,255 --> 00:24:17,003
I miss you, buddy.

424
00:24:17,265 --> 00:24:19,653
Oh, and Meg went
on her first date.

425
00:24:19,678 --> 00:24:22,081
- Mom.
- ...last weekend. Well, you did.

426
00:24:22,106 --> 00:24:24,788
- Wow. Really?
- Um-hum.

427
00:24:24,813 --> 00:24:26,701
- Get off.
- Peach.

428
00:24:29,322 --> 00:24:31,243
I missed you, honey.

429
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:33,488
Mom? Mom.

430
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:35,493
Missed the kids...

431
00:24:37,206 --> 00:24:38,858
a lot.

432
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:41,449
Peach.

433
00:24:41,474 --> 00:24:44,502
Listen, I got to get
the kids to school.

434
00:24:44,527 --> 00:24:46,679
So, I got to run.

435
00:24:48,038 --> 00:24:49,167
Okay.

436
00:24:49,192 --> 00:24:50,920
Yeah. Go careful.

437
00:24:50,945 --> 00:24:52,667
Bye bye.

438
00:24:55,513 --> 00:24:57,529
Is Dad okay?

439
00:24:58,961 --> 00:25:00,719
Just... he never calls.

440
00:25:00,744 --> 00:25:02,197
He's...

441
00:25:02,469 --> 00:25:04,692

- Come on.
- Come on, Beck.

You don't dance.
You don't climb.

Yeah, you want some?

No. I'll...
I'll wait till we summit.

457
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,249
I don't know about that, Neal.

458
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,650
We'll get there.

459
00:25:55,868 --> 00:25:57,154
I'm excited.

460
00:25:57,179 --> 00:26:00,993
Anyway, me and Anatoli are here
to help you, you know.

461
00:26:02,792 --> 00:26:05,558
It's too much competition, Anatoli.

462
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:12,015
We don't need competition
between people.

463
00:26:14,641 --> 00:26:19,650
This competition, between
every person and this mountain.

464
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:26,269
The last word always
belongs to the mountain.

465
00:26:38,857 --> 00:26:42,434
LHOTSE FACE: 12,400 ft 7,132 m.

- Yeah!

467
00:26:52,303 --> 00:26:54,950
Stay there, Beck. Stay there.

468
00:26:55,098 --> 00:26:57,341
Okay, I'm coming down.

469
00:27:01,112 --> 00:27:03,162
Harold, Mike. The rope.

470
00:27:03,187 --> 00:27:05,936
This isn't happening, guys.

471
00:27:06,715 --> 00:27:08,676
Let's turn him around.

472
00:27:09,285 --> 00:27:11,376
Get him off the Face,
and back to the Base Camp.

473
00:27:11,401 --> 00:27:12,558
Turn around.

474
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:14,262
Ang Dorjee. Come on,
we're going down.

475
00:27:14,287 --> 00:27:15,512
Okay.

476
00:27:20,724 --> 00:27:22,482
My hands!

477
00:27:23,835 --> 00:27:26,794
Okay, make a fist again.
Just kind of keep clenching

478
00:27:26,819 --> 00:27:28,729
to keep the blood flow.

479
00:27:31,452 --> 00:27:33,102
What's going on, man?

480
00:27:33,127 --> 00:27:35,511
Still waiting for the south Africans.

481
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,489
Taiwanese took forever as well.

482
00:27:39,915 --> 00:27:42,642
Hey, Ian.
You haven't paid for these ladders.

483
00:27:42,667 --> 00:27:45,885
Yeah, yeah.
Your yak fun money is coming.

484
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:49,609
- You serious man?
- Come on. Get a move on.

485
00:27:55,742 --> 00:27:58,248
- How long you're been waiting him?
- A good 45 minutes.

486
00:27:58,273 --> 00:28:00,602
- Man, it's freezing.
- Yeah.

487
00:28:00,627 --> 00:28:02,665
- Stinging, huh?
- Yeah.

488
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:05,699
- Hey, Rob, we got to get him over!
- We're working on it.

489
00:28:05,724 --> 00:28:07,600
He's freezing, man.

490
00:28:08,802 --> 00:28:10,668
- Are you set?
- Yeah.

491
00:28:10,693 --> 00:28:13,513
- We're sending him over, mate.
- Do it.

492
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,052
Keep going, Beck.

493
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:23,745
Looking good.

494
00:28:30,719 --> 00:28:34,076
- That's it.
- Now, head up, mate. Head up.

495
00:28:50,618 --> 00:28:52,720
Hold on, Beck!

496
00:28:52,762 --> 00:28:54,010
- Whoaaaa.
- Pull. Pull.

497
00:28:54,035 --> 00:28:56,559
Help. Help! Help!

498
00:28:56,584 --> 00:28:58,524
Beck, you alright?

499
00:28:58,549 --> 00:28:59,966
Are these ladders
going to take 2.

500
00:28:59,991 --> 00:29:01,711
Yeah. I'll get a rope.
I'll belay you, okay!

501
00:29:01,723 --> 00:29:04,206
- Stay right where you are, mate.
- I can't pull yourself up!

502
00:29:04,231 --> 00:29:06,570
I'm going to come after you.

503
00:29:06,734 --> 00:29:09,464
Good-Good, Beck. You're okay.

504
00:29:09,683 --> 00:29:11,049
Untie these,
you got to tie me in.

505
00:29:11,074 --> 00:29:12,176
Come and get me.

506
00:29:12,201 --> 00:29:13,595
- On belay.
- Got it, on belay.

507
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,930
Let's go.

508
00:29:14,955 --> 00:29:17,961
I'm coming after you, Beck.
Here I come, mate.

509
00:29:23,365 --> 00:29:25,793
Nice and easy,

510
00:29:27,262 --> 00:29:29,402
- I can't feel my hands!
- Looking good.

511
00:29:29,427 --> 00:29:30,434
Help me.

512
00:29:30,459 --> 00:29:31,505
- Beck. Beck. Beck.
- Help me!

513
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:33,054
Stay right where you are, mate.

514
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:34,412
- Can't pull myself up.
- I'm right here. I'm here.

515
00:29:34,437 --> 00:29:36,529
I can't pull myself up!

516
00:29:36,564 --> 00:29:37,974
I got you.

517
00:29:46,902 --> 00:29:48,576
You okay?

518
00:29:49,062 --> 00:29:51,865
No guarantees to the Summit.
I get it.

519
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,948
I can get killed because
I'm waiting in line.

520
00:29:53,973 --> 00:29:56,246
Like I'm in a freaking Wal-mart.

521
00:29:56,467 --> 00:29:59,602
Not while I paid you $65,000.

522
00:29:59,627 --> 00:30:02,053
Now get me off of here.

523
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:06,635
That's it.
Plant your feet, one at a time.

524
00:30:12,731 --> 00:30:15,067
Alright, thanks for coming by.
(Meeting for guides, organizers)

525
00:30:15,092 --> 00:30:18,339
Look. Base Camp as you know
is chalked up all this year, so...

526
00:30:18,364 --> 00:30:20,567
I think it'll
all benefit us greatly

527
00:30:20,592 --> 00:30:22,366
by coming together like this
and you know,

528
00:30:22,391 --> 00:30:24,353
working out some kind
of plan and schedule.

529
00:30:24,378 --> 00:30:26,966
- What, like some kind of rotor?
- Yes.

530
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,694
On Everest.

531
00:30:30,065 --> 00:30:33,324
Everyone knows Everest is a business
for you, Rob, but are you kidding?

532
00:30:33,349 --> 00:30:36,026
What gives you the right to tell us
when we can climb and when we can't.

533
00:30:36,051 --> 00:30:38,049
I'm not telling you, man.
I'm asking.

534
00:30:38,074 --> 00:30:40,524
If we know when everybody is
planning to summit, for instance...

535
00:30:40,549 --> 00:30:44,081
You know we can avoid the chaos
that happened at the Icefall today.

536
00:30:44,382 --> 00:30:46,749
Adventure Consultants
are aiming for May 10th.

537
00:30:46,774 --> 00:30:48,044
So are we, man.

538
00:30:48,069 --> 00:30:50,470
- Us too.
- May 10th.

539
00:30:52,449 --> 00:30:55,361
Okay, that's bumper to bumper
traffic on the Hillary step.

540
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:56,670
Yes it is, that's my point.

541
00:30:56,695 --> 00:31:00,168
Look, this is ridiculous.
We summiting when we want.

542
00:31:00,193 --> 00:31:04,167
Alright. And I don't need
your permission to climb the mountain.

543
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:06,059
Ian, have you seen how
many people are here

544
00:31:06,099 --> 00:31:07,989
- ...at Base Camp this year.
- We're finish here.

545
00:31:08,014 --> 00:31:10,107
- Come on, lads.
- Hey, man.

546
00:31:25,471 --> 00:31:27,430
Ah. Come in, man.

547
00:31:27,455 --> 00:31:28,821
- Hi.
- Ha ha.

548
00:31:28,846 --> 00:31:31,273
- Have a drink, Rob.
- Yeah, have a drink.

549
00:31:31,298 --> 00:31:32,684
Na zdorovye. (*To health.)

550
00:31:32,709 --> 00:31:35,177
- Nostrovia. (*Cheers)
- Nostrovia. (*Cheers)

551
00:31:35,202 --> 00:31:37,896
- With a word. Yeh.
- Um-hum.

552
00:31:42,829 --> 00:31:45,822
- You're a little crook, huh.
- I know, it's just a little.

553
00:31:45,847 --> 00:31:49,529
- A little touch of the deli belly.
- He means Buddha belly.

554
00:31:53,738 --> 00:31:56,331
What's going on Roberto?

555
00:32:03,747 --> 00:32:07,053
I don't like the look of the
crowds on the ropes.

556
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:10,685
We ran into some trouble
once we're above Camp 3.

557
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:13,119
Well. You want to top
on the 10th, yeah?

558
00:32:13,144 --> 00:32:14,990
- Yeah.
- So do I.

559
00:32:16,581 --> 00:32:18,484
What're you saying,
we should team up?

560
00:32:18,509 --> 00:32:20,788
Well, it's an idea, yeah.

561
00:32:21,892 --> 00:32:24,223
Oh, man.

562
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,804
Oh, I don't know, man.

563
00:32:27,829 --> 00:32:30,563
We have different styles, man.
Like...

564
00:32:31,307 --> 00:32:33,268
All due respect,
you're a hand holder.

565
00:32:33,293 --> 00:32:35,827
I mean the best, but...

566
00:32:35,852 --> 00:32:38,169
I just believe that if you can't
get up there yourself

567
00:32:38,194 --> 00:32:40,654
you shouldn't be on
the mountain at all.

568
00:32:41,109 --> 00:32:43,448
You guide your team,
I guide my.

569
00:32:43,473 --> 00:32:47,004
I'm just suggesting that we work
with each other instead of against.

570
00:32:47,029 --> 00:32:50,229
The only way we both summit, mate,
is that we work together.

571
00:32:50,254 --> 00:32:52,732
Particularly fixing the ropes.

572
00:32:53,235 --> 00:32:55,396
It's got to make sense.

573
00:32:57,614 --> 00:32:59,466
Ah.

574
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,373
Why not.

575
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:07,142
- Oh Yeah.
- Yeah, I see the sense in it.

576
00:33:07,167 --> 00:33:08,392
Okay then.

577
00:33:08,417 --> 00:33:10,844
- Thanks, Scott.
- Alright.

578
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:13,650
Who's going to lead
when we get up there.

579
00:33:18,442 --> 00:33:21,761
Rob, if I say I want to lead,
could it be done?

580
00:33:26,377 --> 00:33:27,596
- Whoa whoa whoa.
- Okay, hey.

581
00:33:27,621 --> 00:33:30,948
You got to work with Ang Dorjee.
'cause we're working together now.

582
00:33:31,669 --> 00:33:36,172
He's just saying if both of us...
Whoa whoa whoa whoa.

583
00:33:36,683 --> 00:33:37,986
Okay.

584
00:33:38,451 --> 00:33:39,914
Ang Dorjee.

585
00:33:41,564 --> 00:33:42,919
We're all professionals here.

586
00:33:42,944 --> 00:33:44,588
We work together and
we get the job done.

587
00:33:44,613 --> 00:33:46,459
- Yes?
- Alright, yeah.

588
00:33:46,484 --> 00:33:49,379
We're planning of stashing,
what 8 bottles of "O"

589
00:33:49,404 --> 00:33:50,716
over the South Summit.

590
00:33:50,741 --> 00:33:53,058
- Well, I'm not using "O".
- What do you mean?

591
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:55,098
- You're not using oxygen at all?
- Come on man, you know you want it.

592
00:33:55,123 --> 00:33:56,809
In his health, don't need it.

593
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:59,392
Yeah, but Anatoli,
you're guiding for Scott this year.

594
00:33:59,417 --> 00:34:01,625
You have people's lives
in your hands. It's a job.

595
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:04,576
Never used it. Never will.

596
00:34:04,601 --> 00:34:07,317
Bigger problems if you run out.

597
00:34:07,924 --> 00:34:09,302
Okay.

598
00:34:09,583 --> 00:34:11,016
I'll put some more
bottles of "O" up there.

599
00:34:11,041 --> 00:34:13,184
- You know, that would be good.
- Alright.

600
00:34:13,512 --> 00:34:14,719
Just as long as
you guys are clear.

601
00:34:14,744 --> 00:34:17,500
You work for me you use oxygen,
otherwise you don't work for me.

602
00:34:17,533 --> 00:34:18,810
Hey, you don't have to ask me.

603
00:34:18,835 --> 00:34:20,758
I've been up here before
without "O" s, Rob.

604
00:34:20,784 --> 00:34:22,254
I don't need to
deal with clients.

605
00:34:22,279 --> 00:34:24,442
- Alright. Next we have the fixed ropes.
- Yeah.

606
00:34:24,467 --> 00:34:27,362
Particularly, above the Lhotse Face.

607
00:34:27,387 --> 00:34:29,104
You let us start
make new fixed rope.

608
00:34:29,129 --> 00:34:31,019
- And Southeast Ridge as well.
- Yes, it does.

609
00:34:31,044 --> 00:34:33,189
Well. My idea is that
we work together

610
00:34:33,214 --> 00:34:35,532
and we fix ropes together,
we share the duties.

611
00:34:35,557 --> 00:34:36,750
- Okay.
- Sounds good.

612
00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:38,335
Alright, you and Lopsang
maybe get together,

613
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:41,474
talk about who want to
fix what and where, okay?

614
00:34:41,627 --> 00:34:43,398
Ah. Only essentials.

615
00:34:43,423 --> 00:34:46,638
I'm not going to tell you what to pack,
but be brutal, okay.

616
00:34:46,663 --> 00:34:49,636
1 pound down here
is like 10 up there.

617
00:34:50,055 --> 00:34:52,900
Light and fast. Light and fast.

618
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:56,948
What, and just like that
you-you killed my summit cappuccino.

619
00:34:57,336 --> 00:34:59,790
Go go go. Run.

620
00:34:59,823 --> 00:35:02,438
That camera is totally daine.
( May 5th )

621
00:35:02,469 --> 00:35:04,707
Alright, it's going to be a tough week.
( May 5th )

622
00:35:04,732 --> 00:35:08,063
But, it's going to be the
best Friday of your lives.

623
00:35:08,088 --> 00:35:10,375
Hey, what-what are we
doing in a boat?

624
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,978
- Summiting! - Summiting!
- Summiting...!

625
00:35:15,262 --> 00:35:17,089
- Now it's up to me, right?
- Yeah, you.

626
00:35:17,114 --> 00:35:18,120
I take 3.

627
00:35:18,145 --> 00:35:21,142
- It's from Jan.
- You can't look at my card.

628
00:35:22,273 --> 00:35:24,002
I knew it was
going to be a girl.

629
00:35:24,027 --> 00:35:26,100
I can't believe it.

630
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:27,461
It's a girl!

631
00:35:27,486 --> 00:35:30,549
- Yeah!
- That's great.

632
00:35:30,574 --> 00:35:32,035
Alright, good on you.

633
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:34,423
I know. I knew. I knew she was.

634
00:35:34,448 --> 00:35:37,142
- Thank you. Thank you, Doug.
- Cheers, mate.

635
00:35:37,167 --> 00:35:38,801
When is she due?

636
00:35:38,826 --> 00:35:40,375
Mid July.
As soon as I get back.

637
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,748
- You can't leave now, buddy.
- Yeah, that's true.

638
00:35:43,783 --> 00:35:45,305
Hey, Rob.

639
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:46,745
Yeah?

640
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:48,615
Jan doesn't mind you being here?

641
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,183
Oh oh.
Krakauer's sword is unleashed.

642
00:35:52,208 --> 00:35:54,795
It's okay. I'm...
Jan's a climber, Jon. She gets it.

643
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,787
- Oh yeah?
- She is, Helen.

644
00:35:56,812 --> 00:35:58,319
Now you, Doug.
What about your wife?

645
00:35:58,344 --> 00:36:01,421
Oh, she's been fine with it
ever since we divorced.

646
00:36:01,648 --> 00:36:03,444
She's been great with
everything since then.

647
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:04,441
I'm so sorry, buddy.

648
00:36:04,466 --> 00:36:05,968
- Oh, no, don't.
- I'm sorry.

649
00:36:05,993 --> 00:36:07,606
No no no. I asked because.

650
00:36:07,631 --> 00:36:11,022
Peach said to me, "If you climb
1 more mountain, I will divorce you."

651
00:36:11,047 --> 00:36:12,807
And you went ahead
and then booked this trip.

652
00:36:12,812 --> 00:36:14,687
- Oh.
- Ow...

653
00:36:14,712 --> 00:36:17,669
No no no. The worst-
The worst part of it is that, I...

654
00:36:17,694 --> 00:36:20,509
I kind of forgot to tell her.

655
00:36:20,534 --> 00:36:22,944
- No.
- Ha ha ha.

656
00:36:22,969 --> 00:36:24,905
I forgot to tell her. I did.

657
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:27,800
Alright.
It's all on the table here.

658
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:30,612
It hurts. It's dangerous. It...

659
00:36:30,637 --> 00:36:33,747
destroys relationships.
It's costing you all a small fortune.

660
00:36:33,772 --> 00:36:35,384
- Were there any negative aspects?
- Yeah.

661
00:36:35,409 --> 00:36:38,327
Come on, I got to ask the question.
You know I do.

662
00:36:38,715 --> 00:36:40,240
Why?

663
00:36:41,439 --> 00:36:43,272
Why?

664
00:36:44,361 --> 00:36:45,104
Because.

665
00:36:45,129 --> 00:36:47,598
- Because it's there!
- It's there! - It's there!

666
00:36:47,623 --> 00:36:49,686
That's why.
Thank you Mr. Mallory.

667
00:36:49,711 --> 00:36:52,238
Come on, guys, I'm-I'm serious.

668
00:36:52,263 --> 00:36:53,728
- Yasuko.
- Huh?

669
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,864
Why are you climbing Everest?

670
00:36:56,532 --> 00:36:57,542
Uh.

671
00:36:57,567 --> 00:36:59,824
I'm 47 years old.

672
00:36:59,854 --> 00:37:02,219
I have reached
6 of the 7 summits.

673
00:37:02,244 --> 00:37:07,049
So. Of course, now I have to
reach the 7th.

674
00:37:07,074 --> 00:37:08,265
- It's not an answer.
- Oh.

675
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:10,142
Why... No, why any summits?

676
00:37:10,167 --> 00:37:12,665
- Well. I...
- Doug.

677
00:37:12,811 --> 00:37:14,295
Why?

678
00:37:14,892 --> 00:37:17,043
- Come on. Tell him about the kids.
- What.

679
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,412
- Tell him about the kids.
- Yeah.

680
00:37:18,437 --> 00:37:21,634
- Oh. I...
- You have kids?

681
00:37:21,741 --> 00:37:23,453
Yeah, I have kids. But...

682
00:37:23,478 --> 00:37:27,697
I thought I told you their's...
their elementary school back home.

683
00:37:27,722 --> 00:37:29,871
I've been going and talking
to the kids there and they

684
00:37:29,896 --> 00:37:33,121
actual helped me raised some
of the money to come and...

685
00:37:33,151 --> 00:37:36,289
gave me a flag to plant
on the Summit and...

686
00:37:36,733 --> 00:37:39,712
so, I was thinking maybe it's...

687
00:37:39,737 --> 00:37:45,788
they see an... a regular guy can,
you know, follow impossible dreams.

688
00:37:45,813 --> 00:37:50,258
Maybe they will be inspired to
do the same, I guess.

689
00:37:50,336 --> 00:37:56,418
I'm climbing Mount Everest
because I can.

690
00:37:56,950 --> 00:38:02,434
Because, to be able to climb that high and
see that kind of beauty nobody ever sees,

691
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:05,787
it'll be a crime not to.

692
00:38:07,155 --> 00:38:08,241
Yeh yeh, Dougy.

693
00:38:08,266 --> 00:38:10,543
- There you go.
- I like that.

694
00:38:15,654 --> 00:38:16,795
Hello.

695
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:19,453
Hey. Did I wake you?

696
00:38:19,751 --> 00:38:21,373
No.

697
00:38:21,551 --> 00:38:24,067
I did to, you liar.

698
00:38:26,878 --> 00:38:29,209
- You okay?
- Yeah.

699
00:38:29,234 --> 00:38:32,513
Yeah yeah, I'm good.
I'm better. I'm better now.

700
00:38:33,008 --> 00:38:34,636
I missed you.

701
00:38:35,544 --> 00:38:37,997
We go for the final ascend tomorrow.

702
00:38:38,022 --> 00:38:40,990
Oh. So, you're...
you summit on Friday?

703
00:38:41,022 --> 00:38:42,953
Yeah. 10th.

704
00:38:43,834 --> 00:38:46,790
- It's your lucky day.
- It is.

705
00:38:46,815 --> 00:38:48,478
How's the weather?

706
00:38:48,961 --> 00:38:50,495
It's good.

707
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,690
Yeah, I think we're going to
get a good window.

708
00:38:53,062 --> 00:38:56,856
- So... It's a girl.
- Oh yeah.

709
00:38:56,888 --> 00:38:59,542
And, did you go to the doctor?
Did you get your scan done?

710
00:38:59,567 --> 00:39:02,223
- Did you see her?
- Yes, we're good.

711
00:39:04,072 --> 00:39:06,896
And?
Come on, what does she look like?

712
00:39:06,921 --> 00:39:09,849
Oh, you know.
Blonde hair, nice smile.

713
00:39:09,874 --> 00:39:13,260
Perfect height-weight ratio,
she's going to be a great climber.

714
00:39:14,903 --> 00:39:18,828
She's there, Rob... already.

715
00:39:19,204 --> 00:39:21,647
- Wow.
- Me and you.

716
00:39:21,672 --> 00:39:23,907
And a little bear, huh.

717
00:39:25,048 --> 00:39:26,751
And in one day,

718
00:39:26,776 --> 00:39:29,796
you, me,

719
00:39:30,087 --> 00:39:33,231
and our little Sarah, we'll all
go climbing together. Huh.

720
00:39:33,256 --> 00:39:35,137
Sarah?

721
00:39:35,527 --> 00:39:37,495
Yeah. What do you think?

722
00:39:37,521 --> 00:39:39,620
- No way.
- Come on.

723
00:39:39,645 --> 00:39:42,079
- No.
- Please, think about it.

724
00:39:42,104 --> 00:39:44,096
- No.
- Huh.

725
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:51,690
- You're still there?
- Of course I'm still here.

726
00:39:54,394 --> 00:39:56,072
I love you.

727
00:39:56,378 --> 00:39:58,365
I love you too.

728
00:40:02,685 --> 00:40:04,269
Sleep well, my love.

729
00:40:04,293 --> 00:40:06,650
Alright. Bye.

* Everest climbers

731
00:41:22,334 --> 00:41:24,968
Take it easy now,
you're going to be okay.

732
00:41:24,993 --> 00:41:27,033
Okay, we're going to get
you down the hill. Alright.

733
00:41:27,041 --> 00:41:28,791
Hey, Neal. You okay?

734
00:41:28,816 --> 00:41:31,126
Yeah.
Dale, he doesn't look too good.

735
00:41:31,349 --> 00:41:33,777
- I need to take him down.
- Yeah.

736
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,949
You can't get Scott
on the radio?

737
00:41:35,974 --> 00:41:39,003
No.
No, I think he's-he's up ahead.

738
00:41:48,517 --> 00:41:50,669
Best not to stay
too long at the Summit.

739
00:41:50,694 --> 00:41:52,804
It's a long way to go, man.

740
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,581
Head down, one step at a time.

741
00:41:58,606 --> 00:42:00,713
You got it, boss.

742
00:42:03,048 --> 00:42:04,745
You seen Dale?

743
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:07,704
Yeah, and he wasn't
looking too good, but...

744
00:42:07,729 --> 00:42:10,956
Neal seem to have
handle the situation.

745
00:42:10,981 --> 00:42:12,341
Try to use your radio.

746
00:42:12,366 --> 00:42:14,832
- You kidding me.
- No.

747
00:42:15,026 --> 00:42:17,420
Guess it's not working, huh.

748
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,800
I'm going down to Camp 1.

749
00:42:19,825 --> 00:42:21,778
If he's not doing so well,
I'm going to take him down to Base Camp.

750
00:42:21,803 --> 00:42:23,146
And I'll head back up.

751
00:42:23,171 --> 00:42:26,003
- You guys alright?
- Yeah.

752
00:42:27,148 --> 00:42:29,023
He can't be too far
ahead of you, mate.

753
00:42:29,048 --> 00:42:31,830
Yeah.
I'll make it down in half the time.

754
00:42:32,962 --> 00:42:35,934
I'm going to catch him. Woo.

755
00:42:40,208 --> 00:42:41,568
Cheers, mate.

(MOUNT PUMORI, 5 MILES WEST OF EVEREST)

00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:02,332
Good to hear you, Guy.
Where are you?

761
00:43:02,357 --> 00:43:04,517
Camp 1, Pumori.

762
00:43:04,542 --> 00:43:06,450
Yeah.

763
00:43:06,475 --> 00:43:09,200
There you go,

764
00:43:09,404 --> 00:43:12,326
Listen, I think you're on the
wrong mountain there.

765
00:43:12,597 --> 00:43:14,607
Look, I can't talk and
we got to get out of here.

766
00:43:14,632 --> 00:43:18,118
Alright, mate. Oh, listen.
You take care on the kiddy slope.

767
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:20,103
I ought to get back
to the real thing.

768
00:43:20,128 --> 00:43:22,909
Hey, don't worry, Rob.
I'll keep an eye on you.

769
00:43:32,065 --> 00:43:34,416
Aye! Watch out!

770
00:43:35,452 --> 00:43:36,747
Aw!

771
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,391
ROB!

772
00:43:39,415 --> 00:43:41,576
- Rob!
- I got you.

773
00:43:51,919 --> 00:43:53,785
Harold, you okay?

774
00:43:57,048 --> 00:43:58,712
Is everyone okay?

775
00:43:58,737 --> 00:44:00,469
We're okay!

776
00:44:05,571 --> 00:44:07,413
Come here, come here, come here.
Sit. Sit down, sit.

777
00:44:07,438 --> 00:44:09,036
I'm fine.

778
00:44:10,498 --> 00:44:11,903
Look at me.

779
00:44:11,928 --> 00:44:13,149
- Look at me!
- I'm fine, mate.

780
00:44:13,174 --> 00:44:14,332
Look at me, Harold.

781
00:44:14,357 --> 00:44:16,164
Look.
I'm tell you, I'm alright.

782
00:44:16,189 --> 00:44:18,151
- Okay.
- I'm alright.

783
00:44:20,125 --> 00:44:21,825
- Harold.
- Thank you.

784
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:23,924
Don't do that to me again, aye.

785
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:26,903
Rob, I'm sorry.

786
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:29,062
Okay, mate.

787
00:44:29,087 --> 00:44:32,118
I'll get drop back with Frank,
he's struggling, alright?

788
00:44:32,215 --> 00:44:34,510
- Alright.
- Okay.

789
00:44:36,227 --> 00:44:39,777
- Alright. Straight here.

791
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:43,204
Bravo to Scott Fischer.
Bravo to Scott Fischer.

792
00:44:43,229 --> 00:44:45,173
Mountain Madness, how do you copy?

793
00:44:45,198 --> 00:44:47,917
Hey, man. Scott here.

794
00:44:47,942 --> 00:44:50,910
I've been down to Base Camp
and I'm back to Camp 1.

795
00:44:50,935 --> 00:44:52,279
I'm catch you tomorrow.

796
00:44:52,304 --> 00:44:55,023
What? You not going to
rest up a day first, huh?

797
00:44:56,206 --> 00:45:00,100
Scott, you sound a little rough.
Hey, take an extra day.

798
00:45:00,125 --> 00:45:03,301
No way, Jose.
What, miss out on all the fun.

799
00:45:03,858 --> 00:45:07,613
It's a lot of up and down in...
one day even for you, Scott.

800
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:10,048
You know what they say, man.

801
00:45:10,335 --> 00:45:13,108
It's not the altitude,
it's the attitude.

802
00:45:14,695 --> 00:45:16,469
You sure you're
going to be okay?

803
00:45:16,494 --> 00:45:17,792
- Scott?
- I'll be good.

804
00:45:17,817 --> 00:45:20,779
Just taking a shot of
dexamethasone now.

805
00:45:21,662 --> 00:45:23,651
Just don't push yourself too hard.

806
00:45:23,676 --> 00:45:25,789
Okay? Over and out.

807
00:45:32,075 --> 00:45:35,695
Rob, I've just been over the Miles
to get a weather update.

808
00:45:35,906 --> 00:45:40,497
It's moving fast.
It's changed course slightly

809
00:45:40,522 --> 00:45:44,223
and it could still go north but
if it doesn't.

810
00:45:44,248 --> 00:45:48,689
It's gonna hit sometime
on the 11th, I reckon.

811
00:45:50,524 --> 00:45:52,947
Get some weather forecast, Helen.

812
00:45:52,972 --> 00:45:55,133
The mountain makes it's own weather.

813
00:45:55,158 --> 00:45:57,095
We're keeping an eye on it.

814
00:45:57,215 --> 00:45:59,435
Yeah, sure.
Just, letting you know.

815
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:01,200
Appreciate it, Helen.

816
00:46:03,759 --> 00:46:06,567
Why we do this to ourselves?

817
00:46:10,182 --> 00:46:12,333
Oh, this is crazy.

818
00:46:17,337 --> 00:46:19,558
You know I never told
Krakauer this.

819
00:46:19,583 --> 00:46:22,262
When he was asking us
why we climb Everest.

820
00:46:22,357 --> 00:46:24,066
When I'm at home...

821
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,176
I just got this big...

822
00:46:28,997 --> 00:46:31,386
black cloud following me.

823
00:46:31,411 --> 00:46:33,512
You know, like a depression.

824
00:46:34,338 --> 00:46:36,259
When I'm out here...

825
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,871
on a mountain, any mountain,

826
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:42,954
it's just like it's a cure.

827
00:46:44,428 --> 00:46:46,523
Feel like I'm reborn.

828
00:46:47,016 --> 00:46:49,015
So, you're happy now?

829
00:46:50,504 --> 00:46:52,716
Now I'm starting to wonder.

830
00:46:55,406 --> 00:46:57,460
This is suffering, man.

831
00:46:59,118 --> 00:47:00,956
This is suffering.

832
00:47:00,981 --> 00:47:02,765
Yeah.

833
00:47:02,958 --> 00:47:05,546
Suffer a few more days.

834
00:47:05,769 --> 00:47:09,412
The rest of your life, you'll be the guy
that climb to the top of Everest.

835
00:47:14,738 --> 00:47:16,894
I just hope I get there.

836
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:19,491
Yeah.

837
00:47:20,532 --> 00:47:23,071
Just hope I get there
and get home.

838
00:47:29,397 --> 00:47:31,162
What do you think, Mike?

839
00:47:33,835 --> 00:47:37,757
Almost pretty good.
A little bit of wind up high.

840
00:47:38,059 --> 00:47:40,246
I mean, if it picks up, we can
always come back down.

841
00:47:40,271 --> 00:47:43,079
- Exactly.
- It's your call, Rob.

842
00:47:43,916 --> 00:47:45,800
Let's get them all going.

843
00:48:36,794 --> 00:48:40,240
CAMP FOUR: 26,085 ft 7,951 m.

844
00:48:40,265 --> 00:48:41,911
Hey, Rob!

845
00:48:41,936 --> 00:48:45,583
- You, okay?
- Not good!

846
00:48:50,589 --> 00:48:53,635
I'm hoping it's going to
die down after sun down.

847
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:55,627
Been doing that.

848
00:48:55,782 --> 00:48:57,337
I don't like this.

849
00:48:57,362 --> 00:49:00,553
We don't go if it doesn't calm.

850
00:49:00,752 --> 00:49:04,708
- I talk to Scott when he come's here.
- Okay.

851
00:49:17,103 --> 00:49:18,355
Scott!

852
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:21,507
- Scott!
- Anatoli, here.

853
00:49:32,024 --> 00:49:34,616
Anatoli, where is Rob?

854
00:49:34,641 --> 00:49:37,173
Where are they? Did he go down?

855
00:49:37,451 --> 00:49:41,109
Where's Rob?
What's Rob's team doing?

856
00:49:41,134 --> 00:49:44,900
Rob will see if it passes.

857
00:49:45,383 --> 00:49:47,352
If he wait.

858
00:49:49,872 --> 00:49:52,712
- We wait.
- Okay.

859
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:57,174
Friday 10th May

860
00:49:58,278 --> 00:50:01,226
00:30 AM

861
00:50:06,372 --> 00:50:08,192
Hey, guys.

862
00:50:08,217 --> 00:50:10,288
Come out and take a look.

863
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:26,989
At least somebody
up there loves us.

864
00:50:27,014 --> 00:50:28,587
Nothing.

865
00:50:32,064 --> 00:50:33,996
Where the storm go?

866
00:50:34,589 --> 00:50:36,306
Exactly.

867
00:50:36,949 --> 00:50:40,626
- That's crazy.
- You ready to saddle up?

868
00:50:42,989 --> 00:50:45,200
Okay, everyone.

869
00:50:45,225 --> 00:50:47,152
We got a window.

870
00:50:47,374 --> 00:50:49,405
We don't know how long
it's going to last.

871
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:51,679
But we're going to go for it.

872
00:50:51,843 --> 00:50:53,864
Be ready in half an hour.

873
00:50:53,889 --> 00:50:56,367
We have a 2 PM turn around.
Let's climb this thing.

874
00:50:56,392 --> 00:50:57,910
Okay.

875
00:51:01,943 --> 00:51:04,413
So, today's the day, huh?

876
00:51:04,754 --> 00:51:06,204
Yeah.

877
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:09,501
Now or never.

878
00:51:12,386 --> 00:51:14,376
Oh boy.

879
00:51:17,297 --> 00:51:19,896
The south Africans were
laid out at Camp 3.

880
00:51:19,921 --> 00:51:22,200
They never made it into Camp 4.

881
00:51:22,225 --> 00:51:23,892
Probably got caught up in it.

882
00:51:23,917 --> 00:51:28,176
- Maybe it blew though early.
- Yeah. Well, it hit us all night.

883
00:51:28,284 --> 00:51:31,051
But that was nothing,
absolutely nothing.

884
00:51:31,076 --> 00:51:33,445
So, it's definitely worth a shot.

885
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:36,455
I'll radio Ed,
tell him you're continuing.

886
00:51:37,191 --> 00:51:39,211
Any messages?

887
00:51:39,236 --> 00:51:42,425
Yeah. Ring Jan, tell her that
we're heading out.

888
00:51:42,450 --> 00:51:45,777
I'll call you, Helen, in 12 hours
when we get to the Summit.

889
00:51:45,802 --> 00:51:47,760
Turn around is 2 PM.

890
00:51:47,785 --> 00:51:49,701
Good luck and
god speed to you all.

891
00:51:49,726 --> 00:51:51,567
Okay. Thanks, Helen. Bye bye.

892
00:51:51,592 --> 00:51:52,894
I'll see you guys up there.

893
00:51:52,919 --> 00:51:54,234
- Take it easy, Scott.
- Let's do it.

894
00:51:54,259 --> 00:51:56,251
I get a couple of hours of sleep
and I'll be right behind you.

895
00:51:56,276 --> 00:51:57,471
- Yeah, okay.
- See you at the top.

896
00:51:57,496 --> 00:52:00,374
- Have fun, Pittman. Yeah.
- You get some rest, okay.

897
00:52:00,399 --> 00:52:01,543
See you there.

898
00:52:01,568 --> 00:52:04,522
- You got the ropes for the Hillary Step?
- Yeah.

899
00:52:04,547 --> 00:52:05,876
- Okay.
- Okay.

900
00:52:05,901 --> 00:52:07,473
Okay.

901
00:52:16,555 --> 00:52:20,454
THE BALCONY: 27,600 ft 8,412 m

902
00:52:20,479 --> 00:52:23,515
04:30 AM

903
00:52:24,158 --> 00:52:26,110
Can we go any faster?

904
00:52:26,135 --> 00:52:27,859
Not a chance we can
go faster here.

905
00:52:27,884 --> 00:52:31,298
It's too difficult.
This could take a while.

906
00:52:32,257 --> 00:52:34,311
We're losing time.

907
00:53:00,475 --> 00:53:02,502
Beck, what's wrong?

908
00:53:02,527 --> 00:53:04,313
I don't know.

909
00:53:06,816 --> 00:53:10,289
I had a operation couple
of years ago on my eyes.

910
00:53:10,314 --> 00:53:12,000
That might be it.

911
00:53:12,025 --> 00:53:13,601
I don't know.

912
00:53:13,885 --> 00:53:17,318
Okay. Guys, go in front of us.

913
00:53:17,352 --> 00:53:20,085
- Alright, Beck, let's sit you down.
- Okay.

914
00:53:26,006 --> 00:53:28,931
Beck. Look at me.

915
00:53:30,683 --> 00:53:32,056
I need to send you down
with someone.

916
00:53:32,081 --> 00:53:33,780
- No. I don't want to go down, Rob.
- No, you got to go down.

917
00:53:33,805 --> 00:53:35,910
I don't want to go down.

918
00:53:39,555 --> 00:53:40,965
Okay.

919
00:53:43,724 --> 00:53:46,734
Alright, Beck. Listen.

920
00:53:46,759 --> 00:53:48,929
You can wait here for half and hour.
Beck, listen to me.

921
00:53:48,954 --> 00:53:54,236
If it gets better by then,
join in the queue and keep going up.

922
00:53:54,261 --> 00:53:55,471
If it doesn't get better, Beck,

923
00:53:55,496 --> 00:53:57,268
- I'm sorry, mate. It's over.
- Okay.

924
00:53:57,293 --> 00:54:01,105
Sherpas are going to go and drop off the extra
oxygen on the south side while they can.

925
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:04,359
I'm going to send one of them
down for you. Is that clear?

926
00:54:04,384 --> 00:54:06,631
- Yeah?
- Alright.

927
00:54:06,656 --> 00:54:09,802
Okay, mate. Alright.

928
00:54:13,163 --> 00:54:14,921
God speed.

929
00:54:15,952 --> 00:54:18,151
Sandy, do you want to go down?

930
00:54:18,176 --> 00:54:20,808
What? No, no way.

931
00:54:20,833 --> 00:54:22,923
Look, Lopsang, I'm going
to make it to the top.

932
00:54:22,948 --> 00:54:25,047
- Do you understand?
- Okay.

933
00:54:25,072 --> 00:54:28,561
- I'm not going back, okay?
- Okay.

934
00:54:29,088 --> 00:54:32,488
THE SOUTH EAST RIDGE

935
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:41,584
Hey, where are the ropes?

936
00:54:41,609 --> 00:54:44,106
There is no rope. No rope.

937
00:54:44,131 --> 00:54:45,989
Yeah?
They should have been fixed.

938
00:54:46,014 --> 00:54:47,644
Do you have more in your pack.

939
00:54:47,669 --> 00:54:50,306
Lopsang has the ropes.
He's not here.

940
00:54:50,331 --> 00:54:53,796
- Harold, no ropes?
- No.

941
00:54:53,821 --> 00:54:56,449
- Harold.
- Neal.

942
00:54:56,474 --> 00:54:57,794
Hey, Rob.

943
00:54:57,819 --> 00:54:59,644
Listen, we got a
problem here, mate.

944
00:54:59,669 --> 00:55:03,386
There's no fixed ropes on the
crevasse to Hillary Step, over.

945
00:55:03,411 --> 00:55:04,932
Where is Ang Dorjee and Lopsang?

946
00:55:04,957 --> 00:55:08,224
Yeah, I got Ang Dorjee here
but there's not sign of Lopsang.

947
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:12,362
So, me, Neal, Anatoli are going
to set some new ones, over.

948
00:55:12,393 --> 00:55:13,757
- Fine then.
- Yeah.

949
00:55:13,782 --> 00:55:16,116
- Good.
- Let's do it.

950
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:23,750
- What's going on?
- No fixed rope.

951
00:55:23,775 --> 00:55:25,423
What?

952
00:55:54,372 --> 00:55:55,925
That's it.

953
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:58,315
1 step at a time, Doug.

954
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:08,617
Come on, Dougy.
Deep breaths, Dougy.

955
00:56:08,642 --> 00:56:10,554
Come on, mate.
Keep it on. Keep it on.

956
00:56:10,579 --> 00:56:12,639
- Rob.
- Deep breaths, Dougy. Hang on.

957
00:56:12,664 --> 00:56:14,182
Hang on.

958
00:56:21,866 --> 00:56:24,050
You can do this, Dougy.

959
00:56:24,075 --> 00:56:26,874
- I know you can, pal.
- Yeah?

960
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:30,809
I don't want to see you
back here a third time, mate.

961
00:56:47,607 --> 00:56:50,917
John. You heading back down?

962
00:56:51,631 --> 00:56:53,354
There's a hold up.

963
00:56:53,379 --> 00:56:55,440
There's no fixed ropes
above the South Summit.

964
00:56:55,465 --> 00:56:56,795
Yeah. I know, mate.

965
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:58,759
But we are sorting that
situation out now.

966
00:56:58,786 --> 00:57:01,110
Ran out of juice waiting.

967
00:57:01,135 --> 00:57:03,676
Go. I'm sorry, Rob.

968
00:57:03,701 --> 00:57:05,825
That's your call, pal.

969
00:57:08,588 --> 00:57:11,268
I don't want to run out
of oxygen up there.

970
00:57:11,826 --> 00:57:13,574
Sorry, Rob.

971
00:57:20,068 --> 00:57:21,643
We've a little bit of a set back.

972
00:57:21,668 --> 00:57:24,842
Lou, Stuart and John Taske
just turned back, just...

973
00:57:24,867 --> 00:57:26,899
just below the South Summit.

974
00:57:26,924 --> 00:57:30,043
- How are the conditions so far?
- Cold and windy.

975
00:57:30,068 --> 00:57:34,015
- Okay, let me know, Rob.
- Okay, Helen. Thanks, bye bye.

976
00:57:35,299 --> 00:57:37,007
I hope we're not looking
at another year

977
00:57:37,032 --> 00:57:39,470
with no clients at the top.

978
00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:41,946
Well, if that ain't going to
move them pretty soon.

979
00:57:41,971 --> 00:57:44,091
They're out of time, aren't they?

980
00:57:44,116 --> 00:57:46,084
Yeah. And...

981
00:57:46,436 --> 00:57:49,675
What's Jon going to say
about that in his article.

982
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:51,716
- It's Rob.
(THE HILLARY STEP: 28,740 ft: 8,760 m)

983
00:57:51,741 --> 00:57:52,819
- Guy.
(THE HILLARY STEP: 28,740 ft: 8,760 m)

984
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:55,148
- We just lost Lou, Stuart and John Taske.
(The Hillary Step: 8,760 metres)

985
00:57:55,173 --> 00:57:57,318
What's going on?
What's the hold up?

986
00:57:57,349 --> 00:57:58,996
Yeah, yeah, mate. We...

987
00:57:59,021 --> 00:58:03,236
We sent Anatoli and Neal
to the top of the Step

988
00:58:03,261 --> 00:58:05,434
fixing the ropes.

989
00:58:05,459 --> 00:58:08,753
We're at the-
at the Face's Step, over.

990
00:58:08,778 --> 00:58:10,135
Rob, Mike.

991
00:58:11,398 --> 00:58:13,431
- How's Doug doing?
- Doug's just behind me.

992
00:58:13,456 --> 00:58:15,733
I left him behind
to scoot forward.

993
00:58:15,758 --> 00:58:17,733
Yeah, I got eyes on you right now.
Yep, that's me.

994
00:58:17,758 --> 00:58:19,748
Let's move this

995
00:58:20,229 --> 00:58:22,018
as quickly as possible, over.

996
00:58:22,043 --> 00:58:25,686
We'll start moving everybody up
as soon as we get the all clear.

997
00:58:26,781 --> 00:58:29,433
Rob to base. Rob to base, Hel.
Copy, Helen.

998
00:58:29,458 --> 00:58:31,614
- You alright?
- Copy. Base camp to Rob.

999
00:58:31,648 --> 00:58:33,482
Have you... Have you
heard from Scott?

1000
00:58:33,507 --> 00:58:36,333
Anyone manage to find
out where he is, over.

1001
00:58:36,434 --> 00:58:39,362
Woo-Eee! Yo, dude.

1002
00:58:39,392 --> 00:58:42,624
Look. Where are you, mate? We got a
real logjam here at the Hillary Step, over.

1003
00:58:42,649 --> 00:58:45,015
- I'm more than an hour behind.
- Just chill.

1004
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:47,765
People just sitting there
using up their oxygen.

1005
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:49,848
Get here as soon as you can.

1006
00:58:51,821 --> 00:58:53,840
- Oh my god. You okay, Beck?
- Yeah.

1007
00:58:53,865 --> 00:58:57,977
Oh I got a little problem with my eyes.
You guys turning back?

1008
00:58:58,002 --> 00:59:00,418
There's a logjam below
the Hillary Step.

1009
00:59:00,443 --> 00:59:03,451
It's crazy. Come down with us.

1010
00:59:03,476 --> 00:59:06,635
No, I can't.
Promise Rob I'd wait for him.

1011
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:08,002
- Your call.
- I'm good.

1012
00:59:08,027 --> 00:59:09,642
See you down there.

1013
00:59:10,413 --> 00:59:13,012
Neal. Andy.

1014
00:59:13,331 --> 00:59:15,255
Okay, Anatoli.

1015
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:16,900
I'm done.

1016
00:59:17,869 --> 00:59:21,461
All through. Safe to climb.

1017
00:59:21,486 --> 00:59:22,858
Okay, we're climbing up!

1018
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:24,143
- Hey, Mike.
- What?

1019
00:59:24,168 --> 00:59:26,050
- You mind if I go first?
- Why.

1020
00:59:26,075 --> 00:59:28,282
I'm running pretty low on "O".

1021
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:31,538
Rob, it's Mike here.

1022
00:59:31,562 --> 00:59:34,124
Eh. We have the all clear
on this end.

1023
00:59:34,681 --> 00:59:38,208
I'm going to stay here with Yasuko
till we got a clear line.

1024
00:59:38,473 --> 00:59:41,851
I'll be here till I get a visual
on Doug. Over and out

1025
01:00:37,066 --> 01:00:39,375
* 01:14 PM *

1026
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:41,188
We did it.

1027
01:01:04,544 --> 01:01:06,193
We did it!

1028
01:01:19,030 --> 01:01:21,045
Thank you very much.

1029
01:01:21,070 --> 01:01:23,300
Thank you, Mom.

1030
01:01:24,441 --> 01:01:27,486
* 02:00 PM *

1031
01:01:35,131 --> 01:01:36,972
Yasuko.

1032
01:01:39,136 --> 01:01:40,492
- Seven.
- Seven.

1033
01:01:40,517 --> 01:01:43,200
- 7 summits.
- 7 summits.

1034
01:01:43,225 --> 01:01:44,421
Come here.

1035
01:01:44,446 --> 01:01:49,003
I'm so proud of you, Yasuko.
So proud.

1036
01:01:49,028 --> 01:01:50,812
Thank you.

1037
01:01:51,808 --> 01:01:55,640
Thank you. Thank you.

1038
01:01:56,176 --> 01:01:58,571
Rob to base. Rob to base.

1039
01:02:01,147 --> 01:02:03,743
Rob, this is Helen.
Hello, where are you?

1040
01:02:03,768 --> 01:02:06,219
I'm at the top of Everest, Helen.
We made it.

1041
01:02:06,243 --> 01:02:07,556
- Yeah.
- They did it.

1042
01:02:07,582 --> 01:02:09,032
Copy us, over.

1043
01:02:09,057 --> 01:02:11,137
Oh, we copy you
loud and clear, Rob.

1044
01:02:11,162 --> 01:02:13,902
It's wonderful to hear
your voice up there.

1045
01:02:13,935 --> 01:02:15,232
Who are you with again, Beck?

1046
01:02:15,257 --> 01:02:17,412
At the moment
I'm with Mike and Yasuko.

1047
01:02:17,437 --> 01:02:18,987
Good job, man.

1048
01:02:19,012 --> 01:02:20,891
Rob, see you. Thank you.

1049
01:02:20,916 --> 01:02:23,646
Jon and Kasischke have
already been and gone.

1050
01:02:23,671 --> 01:02:25,591
Doug is just coming over the horizon.

1051
01:02:25,616 --> 01:02:27,613
And-And what about Beck?

1052
01:02:27,638 --> 01:02:30,337
Beck was having a problem
with his eye sight.

1053
01:02:30,362 --> 01:02:34,804
He waited on the Southeast Ridge,
on the Balcony.

1054
01:02:34,829 --> 01:02:36,985
For the first people
who came back, over.

1055
01:02:37,010 --> 01:02:40,169
And I... I guess you'll be
leaving right away, yes?

1056
01:02:40,194 --> 01:02:42,790
Moving off in a few minutes
just as soon I see Doug,

1057
01:02:42,815 --> 01:02:44,622
we'll be heading
back down, over.

1058
01:02:44,647 --> 01:02:47,589
Alright, understood.
Oh, that's terrific, Rob.

1059
01:02:47,614 --> 01:02:49,897
We're all keeping
our fingers cross for Doug.

1060
01:02:49,922 --> 01:02:51,901
Over and out, Helen.

1061
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:06,039
- Congratulation.
- You're welcome.

1062
01:03:06,064 --> 01:03:09,025
Yeah, ladsy. You did it.

1063
01:03:13,336 --> 01:03:15,309
Woo yee!

1064
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:44,664
You look terrible.

1065
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:49,037
My stories, not so good, man.

1066
01:03:49,324 --> 01:03:52,596
- You see Doug?
- Oh, yeah. He's way way...

1067
01:03:53,084 --> 01:03:55,474
way back there, man.

1068
01:03:55,499 --> 01:03:58,787
Hey, Roberto.
Where're the rest of your guys.

1069
01:03:58,812 --> 01:04:02,258
'Cause I'm pretty sure
my whole team

1070
01:04:02,283 --> 01:04:03,596
made it up, yeah.

1071
01:04:03,621 --> 01:04:05,430
Heh heh heh. I saw them.

1072
01:04:05,455 --> 01:04:07,620
Don't worry.
I won't tell Krakauer.

1073
01:04:07,645 --> 01:04:10,221
Hold on, mate.
I know it's bad, huh.

1074
01:04:10,246 --> 01:04:12,292
I'll have to give you this year.

1075
01:04:12,317 --> 01:04:14,656
Scott, you really
don't look too good.

1076
01:04:14,681 --> 01:04:16,085
- Lopsang.
- Yeah.

1077
01:04:16,110 --> 01:04:18,325
Come, mate. Let's get him down.

1078
01:04:25,086 --> 01:04:26,578
Alright.

1079
01:04:26,790 --> 01:04:28,316
Let's go.

1080
01:04:52,435 --> 01:04:55,492
Harold. What're you doing?

1081
01:04:55,959 --> 01:04:58,188
I'm just trying to
sort out the "O".

1082
01:04:58,227 --> 01:05:00,690
I can't find any full ones.

1083
01:05:00,716 --> 01:05:02,570
There's full bottles,
I saw them on the way up.

1084
01:05:02,595 --> 01:05:03,674
No.

1085
01:05:03,699 --> 01:05:05,500
So I pretty sure you
should have another look.

1086
01:05:05,506 --> 01:05:08,911
- No. They just have, they're not full.
- Harold. Listen, I saw...

1087
01:05:08,936 --> 01:05:11,989
Look, Mike.
I've checked twice, alright.

1088
01:05:12,136 --> 01:05:15,470
Yeah. Alright, man.

1089
01:05:16,368 --> 01:05:18,208
I'm going down.

1090
01:05:19,603 --> 01:05:21,126
Harold.

1091
01:05:23,899 --> 01:05:24,443
03:15 PM

1092
01:05:29,268 --> 01:05:31,159
Doug. Doug. Doug.

1093
01:05:32,256 --> 01:05:33,871
- It's over, mate.
- No.

1094
01:05:33,896 --> 01:05:35,772
I' sorry. No no no no.

1095
01:05:35,797 --> 01:05:38,218
Doug. You're too late, okay.

1096
01:05:38,944 --> 01:05:41,522
You guys keep going, mate,
I'll catch up.

1097
01:05:41,547 --> 01:05:43,283
Doug. Doug. Doug, listen to me.

1098
01:05:43,308 --> 01:05:45,084
- It's way too long, it's over.
- No, it's not.

1099
01:05:45,109 --> 01:05:47,917
Now, listen to me, mate.
I'm sorry.

1100
01:05:47,942 --> 01:05:50,328
But I got to turn you around.

1101
01:05:50,353 --> 01:05:51,855
Okay.

1102
01:05:52,741 --> 01:05:54,418
I can do it.

1103
01:05:55,604 --> 01:05:59,121
It's right here, man.
It's right here.

1104
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:03,052
I'm not coming back next year, man.
It's my last chance.

1105
01:06:06,573 --> 01:06:08,946
You got to let me do this.

1106
01:06:10,373 --> 01:06:12,256
Let me do this.

1107
01:06:12,695 --> 01:06:14,396
- Okay.
- Please, Rob.

1108
01:06:14,421 --> 01:06:17,305
- Let's do it. Let's get it done.
- Alright.

1109
01:06:17,330 --> 01:06:19,640
- Come on.
- Thanks, man.

1110
01:06:23,557 --> 01:06:25,256
Alright, Doug.

1111
01:06:45,803 --> 01:06:49,108
And there's no hope, I get it.

1112
01:06:49,133 --> 01:06:53,616
My double wide trailer.

1113
01:06:57,732 --> 01:06:59,339
- Beck?
- What?

1114
01:06:59,364 --> 01:07:02,503
- Are you okay?
- Who is there?

1115
01:07:02,528 --> 01:07:05,798
- It's Jon.
- I'm not seeing too well, Jon.

1116
01:07:05,823 --> 01:07:07,805
I'm freezing.

1117
01:07:08,724 --> 01:07:10,740
Mike's just behind me.

1118
01:07:10,765 --> 01:07:12,699
He's back there with Yasuko.

1119
01:07:12,724 --> 01:07:16,004
You'll be okay.
Mike's right behind me.

1120
01:07:16,029 --> 01:07:17,812
You okay?

1121
01:07:17,837 --> 01:07:19,650
I'll see you then.

1122
01:07:24,329 --> 01:07:25,225
04:00 PM

1123
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:27,148
There she is. (04:00 PM)

1124
01:07:27,173 --> 01:07:29,175
Almost there, mate.

1125
01:07:30,664 --> 01:07:32,968
Dig deep, Doug. Dig deep.

1126
01:07:32,993 --> 01:07:34,630
There you go.

1127
01:07:45,749 --> 01:07:47,784
There you go.

1128
01:07:48,156 --> 01:07:51,533
Yehhhh!

1129
01:07:54,277 --> 01:07:56,282
Huh, you made it.

1130
01:08:01,251 --> 01:08:02,941
You did it. Huh.

1131
01:08:02,966 --> 01:08:05,821
Yeah. Because of you, man.

1132
01:08:14,974 --> 01:08:17,538
Guy to Rob. You read me, mate?

1133
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:22,203
Guy to Rob. Are you there?

1134
01:08:24,772 --> 01:08:26,712
This going to the kids.

1135
01:08:27,975 --> 01:08:30,336
Yehhh!

1136
01:08:33,383 --> 01:08:35,230
Hang in there, Doug.

1137
01:08:35,255 --> 01:08:36,793
Come on.

1138
01:08:37,111 --> 01:08:38,885
Easy. Here, I got it.

1139
01:08:38,910 --> 01:08:41,379
Yeah. I'm okay.

1140
01:08:41,528 --> 01:08:43,376
Yeah, I got it.

1141
01:08:46,002 --> 01:08:47,730
- Come on, let's get you up.
- I need...

1142
01:08:47,755 --> 01:08:49,028
- Huh?
- Need more "O".

1143
01:08:49,053 --> 01:08:50,335
No, Doug.
We can't give you more "O".

1144
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:52,954
We got to get down
to the South Summit, come on.

1145
01:08:58,150 --> 01:09:01,501
Guy calling to Everest Base Camp.
Are you there, Helen?

1146
01:09:01,682 --> 01:09:03,823
Guy, this is Helen.
How is it going?

1147
01:09:03,848 --> 01:09:05,239
Yeah, I'm fine.

1148
01:09:05,264 --> 01:09:07,257
I got a clear view of the Summit
and...

1149
01:09:07,282 --> 01:09:10,573
you know, we still got climbers up there.
They are not any of ours, right?

1150
01:09:10,598 --> 01:09:13,026
We got 3 up and
they're all on their way down.

1151
01:09:13,051 --> 01:09:14,722
Well. What are they
doing there so late?

1152
01:09:14,747 --> 01:09:18,021
And there's 2 o'clock turn around time,
they're way past it.

1153
01:09:18,046 --> 01:09:21,074
Here we go. Cloud coming out
of the valley. It's a lot of it.

1154
01:09:21,099 --> 01:09:23,523
Thanks.
I'm calling them now, Guy.

1155
01:09:27,134 --> 01:09:29,354
Rob, come in. This is Helen.

1156
01:09:31,323 --> 01:09:33,737
Rob, come in. This is Helen.

1157
01:09:40,538 --> 01:09:41,837
Whoa!

1158
01:09:41,862 --> 01:09:45,871
Easy. Easy. Easy, Dougy.
There you go. There you go.

1159
01:09:46,982 --> 01:09:49,117
We're going to go
around the corner.

1160
01:09:50,477 --> 01:09:52,040
That's it.

1161
01:09:54,606 --> 01:09:56,498
Rob, is that you?

1162
01:09:57,432 --> 01:09:58,810
Beck?

1163
01:09:59,253 --> 01:10:00,636
It's Mike, mate.

1164
01:10:00,661 --> 01:10:03,508
- What're you doing here?
- I can't see, it's bad.

1165
01:10:03,555 --> 01:10:04,933
You guys alright?

1166
01:10:04,958 --> 01:10:06,471
We got a problem with Beck.

1167
01:10:06,496 --> 01:10:08,606
Hey, Mike.
We're getting low on "O".

1168
01:10:08,631 --> 01:10:09,998
We got to move.

1169
01:10:10,023 --> 01:10:11,710
I'll get you to stand up, okay.

1170
01:10:11,735 --> 01:10:14,453
- I'll take Yasuko.
- That's it.

1171
01:10:16,675 --> 01:10:18,329
I got you.

1172
01:10:19,592 --> 01:10:21,289
You're okay.

1173
01:10:23,469 --> 01:10:26,893
Doug, come on. Come on.

1174
01:10:33,986 --> 01:10:35,805
I'm cold.

1175
01:10:36,099 --> 01:10:38,240
<i>Oxygen level: 0</i>

1176
01:10:40,915 --> 01:10:42,568
Mike, Harold, Ang Dorjee,

1177
01:10:42,593 --> 01:10:45,332
put the brakes on, guys.
We got a problem.

1178
01:10:46,865 --> 01:10:48,633
- We're out of gas, Doug.
- Alright.

1179
01:10:48,658 --> 01:10:50,932
We're out of gas. We need to
keep moving, come on.

1180
01:10:50,957 --> 01:10:52,283
Come on.

1181
01:10:53,858 --> 01:10:57,313
Mike, Harold, do you copy?
I need someone...

1182
01:10:57,338 --> 01:11:00,430
I need someone to come
back up with oxygen, over.

1183
01:11:03,036 --> 01:11:05,296
Somebody, please.
I'm begging you.

1184
01:11:06,573 --> 01:11:09,229
Doug, come on, mate. Come on!

1185
01:11:10,364 --> 01:11:12,761
Harold, do you copy, over.

1186
01:11:13,790 --> 01:11:17,376
Has anyone got eyes
on Ang Dorjee?

1187
01:11:17,961 --> 01:11:21,383
Mate, I have just had Ang Dorjee
go past me heading down, over.

1188
01:11:21,408 --> 01:11:23,119
He's going down.

1189
01:11:23,144 --> 01:11:24,674
Can you stop him?
Can you turn him around?

1190
01:11:24,699 --> 01:11:26,460
I need someone
to come back up now.

1191
01:11:26,485 --> 01:11:29,386
Hey! Ang Dorjee.

1192
01:11:30,223 --> 01:11:32,505
Ang Dorjee!

1193
01:11:32,530 --> 01:11:34,500
Base camp, do you copy, over.

1194
01:11:34,525 --> 01:11:36,620
Helen to Rob. Go ahead.

1195
01:11:36,645 --> 01:11:38,031
Helen, please.

1196
01:11:38,056 --> 01:11:41,373
I need a bottle of gas
at the top of the Hillary Step.

1197
01:11:41,398 --> 01:11:43,380
I can't get him down
without it.

1198
01:11:43,405 --> 01:11:45,526
I'm really stuck.

1199
01:11:46,137 --> 01:11:47,299
Understood.

1200
01:11:47,324 --> 01:11:51,165
That you need a bottle of oxygen
at the bottom of the Hillary Step.

1201
01:11:51,190 --> 01:11:53,685
We're sending it up to you
as soon as we can.

1202
01:11:53,710 --> 01:11:56,888
At the top. At the top.

1203
01:11:57,004 --> 01:11:59,339
The last thing I said to
Ang Dorjee was please

1204
01:11:59,364 --> 01:12:01,978
bring 2 bottles of gas
at the South Summit.

1205
01:12:02,003 --> 01:12:05,337
Yes, uh. Copy that, Rob.

1206
01:12:05,362 --> 01:12:09,406
Boys. There's oxygen
at the South Summit, right?

1207
01:12:09,431 --> 01:12:12,088
No, Rob! This is Harold.

1208
01:12:12,113 --> 01:12:16,549
There's no oxygen
at South Summit.

1209
01:12:16,574 --> 01:12:18,951
Repeat. No "O".

1210
01:12:19,770 --> 01:12:22,956
Ang Dorjee stashed
4 bottles there, Harold.

1211
01:12:22,981 --> 01:12:25,114
Harold, where are you?

1212
01:12:27,356 --> 01:12:29,395
Can you hear me, Harold?

1213
01:12:29,516 --> 01:12:31,135
Harold.

1214
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:33,066
Harold, can you hear me?

1215
01:12:33,091 --> 01:12:34,574
Figure it'll take me about

1216
01:12:34,599 --> 01:12:37,467
half an hour to get back up
to the South Summit.

1217
01:12:40,638 --> 01:12:42,191
Okay.

1218
01:12:42,449 --> 01:12:44,054
I'm coming.

1219
01:12:45,485 --> 01:12:46,883
If you don't have oxygen, mate,

1220
01:12:46,914 --> 01:12:48,895
don't come up, don't come up.
We're moving on.

1221
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:50,904
I'm coming up to you, Rob.

1222
01:12:52,141 --> 01:12:54,814
Doug, come on, mate. Come on!

1223
01:12:58,816 --> 01:13:02,703
Rob, this is Base Camp.
Rob, this is Base Camp.

1224
01:13:03,490 --> 01:13:05,389
I copy you, Carol.

1225
01:13:05,414 --> 01:13:08,070
Rob, can you get yourself down?

1226
01:13:09,429 --> 01:13:11,816
Carol, we're not
at that point yet.

1227
01:13:11,841 --> 01:13:14,591
Rob, can you let us know
who you're with?

1228
01:13:15,676 --> 01:13:17,309
I'm with Doug.

1229
01:13:17,334 --> 01:13:18,845
We're both listening.

1230
01:13:18,870 --> 01:13:21,650
Come on, Dougy. Come on, mate.
One more alping, come on.

1231
01:13:21,675 --> 01:13:24,006
Rob, what is Doug's
state of consciousness?

1232
01:13:24,031 --> 01:13:25,835
He's really weak.

1233
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:28,904
He collapsed after he
ran out of oxygen.

1234
01:13:29,173 --> 01:13:33,599
Okay.
Give him 8 mg of dexamethasone.

1235
01:13:33,716 --> 01:13:36,119
That's 2 tablets, Rob.

1236
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:38,133
Guy to Rob.

1237
01:13:38,678 --> 01:13:40,531
Go ahead Guy. I got you, mate.

1238
01:13:40,556 --> 01:13:43,068
Rob, I suggest
you get yourself down.

1239
01:13:43,093 --> 01:13:44,726
You know you're doing
no good up there.

1240
01:13:44,751 --> 01:13:46,482
And we got people we can
send up there to help Doug,

1241
01:13:46,507 --> 01:13:49,779
but you got to get
yourself down, you understand?

1242
01:13:49,804 --> 01:13:52,469
I mean, come on, mate.
We're playing with a man's life here.

1243
01:13:52,494 --> 01:13:55,291
There's no way
I'm leaving Doug behind.

1244
01:13:57,005 --> 01:13:59,025
We got to keep moving, mate.

1245
01:13:59,050 --> 01:14:01,750
We got to keep moving,
we are in some trouble.

1246
01:14:01,775 --> 01:14:05,443
Yeah, Helen gonna... need some help.
So I'm gonna try make my way back.

1247
01:14:05,468 --> 01:14:06,812
- Okay?
- Okay.

1248
01:14:06,837 --> 01:14:09,319
Alright. Go on.

1249
01:14:18,319 --> 01:14:20,956
Hey, Scott. Scott.

1250
01:14:20,982 --> 01:14:22,651
You okay?

1251
01:14:26,573 --> 01:14:28,352
Lopsang.

1252
01:14:28,584 --> 01:14:30,373
Lopsang.

1253
01:14:31,950 --> 01:14:34,123
I'm done, pal.

1254
01:14:35,448 --> 01:14:37,174
I'm done.

1255
01:14:38,708 --> 01:14:42,325
You go, send Anatoli.

1256
01:14:42,903 --> 01:14:46,012
Send Anatoli back with some "O".

1257
01:14:47,818 --> 01:14:48,917
- Okay.
- Go.

1258
01:14:48,942 --> 01:14:50,492
Okay.

1259
01:14:50,860 --> 01:14:54,240
I will send back, Anatoli.

1260
01:14:59,813 --> 01:15:01,826
- Let's go.
- You go down.

1261
01:15:01,851 --> 01:15:03,554
No, mate.

1262
01:15:03,579 --> 01:15:05,187
No. I'm not leaving
you behind, Doug.

1263
01:15:05,212 --> 01:15:06,847
- Come on.
- Got to rest.

1264
01:15:06,872 --> 01:15:08,742
No, Doug! Come on!
Come on with me!

1265
01:15:08,777 --> 01:15:11,580
I need 10 good minutes, Doug.
Come on.

1266
01:15:15,326 --> 01:15:17,279
Please, let me go.

1267
01:15:17,304 --> 01:15:20,644
Damn it.
We're at the bottom of the Step.

1268
01:15:20,853 --> 01:15:24,383
Come on, this leg.
This leg, Dougy, come on.

1269
01:15:24,821 --> 01:15:26,338
Come on.

1270
01:15:26,935 --> 01:15:28,616
Here we go.

1271
01:15:48,133 --> 01:15:49,831
Oh no.

1272
01:15:50,136 --> 01:15:51,697
Oh no.

1273
01:15:51,722 --> 01:15:54,459
Hey. Hold it down.
Hold that down.

1274
01:15:54,484 --> 01:15:57,402
Come on, come on.
Get the chairs.

1275
01:16:37,483 --> 01:16:40,047
No, no, no. Come on, Dougy!

1276
01:16:40,072 --> 01:16:42,604
Go, let's go! Hurry up!

1277
01:17:17,828 --> 01:17:21,875
Doug. I'm going to go to
the South Summit to get oxygen.

1278
01:17:21,900 --> 01:17:24,785
Okay. Got to find oxygen.

1279
01:17:24,810 --> 01:17:27,413
But, you got to stay here!

1280
01:17:27,597 --> 01:17:31,742
Okay, stay here!
Don't move, I'll be back!

1281
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:39,358
Rob. Rob.

1282
01:17:56,305 --> 01:17:58,010
Hey, Rob.

1283
01:18:36,785 --> 01:18:39,212
Hey! Stop!

1284
01:18:39,237 --> 01:18:41,623
That's the wrong way!

1285
01:18:42,334 --> 01:18:43,578
Hey!

1286
01:18:43,603 --> 01:18:45,720
Turn back!

1287
01:19:02,288 --> 01:19:03,994
Easy.

1288
01:19:19,205 --> 01:19:20,875
Hey, Rob!

1289
01:19:21,454 --> 01:19:23,261
Hey, Rob!

1290
01:19:34,558 --> 01:19:36,292
Rob!

1291
01:19:37,661 --> 01:19:39,054
- I got...
- Harold?

1292
01:19:39,085 --> 01:19:41,216
I got oxygen.

1293
01:19:41,241 --> 01:19:45,741
Here.
I found some half empty ones.

1294
01:19:46,465 --> 01:19:48,763
Where's Doug?

1295
01:19:49,622 --> 01:19:51,865
Doug's gone.

1296
01:19:52,505 --> 01:19:54,242
What?

1297
01:19:54,777 --> 01:19:56,851
Gone.

1298
01:20:08,855 --> 01:20:10,067
- Come on.
- Go!

1299
01:20:10,092 --> 01:20:11,854
Come on!

1300
01:20:13,648 --> 01:20:15,275
Camp 4 is that way.

1301
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:18,818
Get up! Let's go.

1302
01:20:19,593 --> 01:20:22,841
Come on. Beck.

1303
01:20:30,630 --> 01:20:33,326
I'll get help!

1304
01:21:10,727 --> 01:21:12,581
Neal!

1305
01:21:14,369 --> 01:21:16,431
Neal!

1306
01:21:17,888 --> 01:21:19,716
- Anatoli.
- Where-Where are they?

1307
01:21:19,741 --> 01:21:21,946
They're still out there.

1308
01:21:28,652 --> 01:21:31,618
Jon! I need help!

1309
01:21:31,749 --> 01:21:32,833
What?

1310
01:21:32,868 --> 01:21:35,454
Get out there! I need help!

1311
01:21:35,479 --> 01:21:37,877
I can't. I can't see, Anatoli.

1312
01:21:37,902 --> 01:21:39,804
I'm snow blind.

1313
01:21:40,368 --> 01:21:43,337
Beck. Doug.

1314
01:21:43,362 --> 01:21:46,637
They need help.
They're still out there.

1315
01:21:48,635 --> 01:21:52,579
I go find them. You stay here.

1316
01:21:56,955 --> 01:22:00,132
12:00 AM

1317
01:22:06,709 --> 01:22:08,420
Good job.

1318
01:22:21,998 --> 01:22:23,985
Hey!

1319
01:22:27,771 --> 01:22:29,596
Anatoli!

1320
01:22:29,621 --> 01:22:33,180
Need "O".

1321
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:38,494
- Can you walk?
- I can't!

1322
01:22:39,887 --> 01:22:42,385
I'll come back!

1323
01:22:42,701 --> 01:22:44,719
I'll stay!

1324
01:22:50,406 --> 01:22:52,136
Give me that, come on.

1325
01:22:52,161 --> 01:22:55,303
- It won't budge. It's frozen!
- Take this.

1326
01:22:56,590 --> 01:22:58,285
The gloves.

1327
01:22:59,350 --> 01:23:01,374
I'm sorry.

1328
01:23:13,294 --> 01:23:14,814
Come on, mate.

1329
01:23:15,662 --> 01:23:17,330
Come on, Harold.

1330
01:23:19,332 --> 01:23:21,546
Thanks for coming back.

1331
01:23:42,758 --> 01:23:45,174
- Hello, Base Camp.
- Helen, it's Jan.

1332
01:23:45,199 --> 01:23:48,265
Why haven't I heard from you?
Why hasn't anybody call me?

1333
01:23:48,290 --> 01:23:52,411
They've been hit by a storm, Jan.
It's really bad.

1334
01:23:53,564 --> 01:23:57,391
- Where is he?
- We don't know exactly. But...

1335
01:23:57,431 --> 01:23:59,327
He was still on the Summit at 4:00.

1336
01:23:59,357 --> 01:24:02,636
Oh no. Can he get down?

1337
01:24:02,661 --> 01:24:05,634
Rob can, but Doug can't.

1338
01:24:05,756 --> 01:24:09,076
There's at least 13 people
stranded up there and...

1339
01:24:09,101 --> 01:24:11,722
while the storm is getting worse.

1340
01:24:15,140 --> 01:24:16,192
Helen!

1341
01:24:16,217 --> 01:24:19,965
Get Ang Dorjee up there.
He'll bring them down.

1342
01:24:20,176 --> 01:24:22,362
- Helen, do you understand?
- Helen. Give me an update.

1343
01:24:22,387 --> 01:24:25,393
Get Ang Dorjee up there.

1344
01:24:25,418 --> 01:24:27,274
Jan, yep. We will get him.

1345
01:24:27,299 --> 01:24:30,262
And I will call you
the minute I hear from him.

1346
01:24:30,287 --> 01:24:32,433
- As soon as I hear from him.
- Thanks, Helen.

1347
01:24:32,458 --> 01:24:34,471
- Alright.
- Okay.

1348
01:24:34,502 --> 01:24:36,409
- Where is he?
- Guy, I haven't heard from him.

1349
01:24:36,434 --> 01:24:39,203
- Okay, I'll get him.
- I've been trying.

1350
01:24:39,228 --> 01:24:41,189
- Guy.
- Just hang on, hang on.

1351
01:24:41,214 --> 01:24:43,326
Rob, it's Guy. Where are you?

1352
01:24:43,351 --> 01:24:45,506
Guy, I've been doing
that for the last 2 hours.

1353
01:24:45,531 --> 01:24:47,996
Alright. Alright.
Rob, it's Guy.

1354
01:24:48,020 --> 01:24:50,773
- Just keep your energy, mate.
- Helen.

1355
01:24:50,798 --> 01:24:53,012
Once you catch a break, you move.
You know the drill.

1356
01:24:53,037 --> 01:24:56,658
Hey, Guy. We got a stash of oxygen
on the South Col.

1357
01:24:56,699 --> 01:24:58,908
- Whoever needs it can have it.
- That's the way, thank you.

1358
01:24:58,933 --> 01:25:01,520
Faust's team are gonna go up,
they got a man to search,

1359
01:25:01,549 --> 01:25:02,968
as soon as they can.

1360
01:25:02,999 --> 01:25:06,740
Anyone who is going, we're going to
leave at dawn with the commity.

1361
01:25:06,765 --> 01:25:07,897
That's right, David.

1362
01:25:07,922 --> 01:25:10,109
Go and let Ed knows what's going on,
I'll be right behind you.

1363
01:25:10,134 --> 01:25:11,629
- Camp 4, come in.
- Okay, great.

1364
01:25:11,654 --> 01:25:13,967
Hey, Rob. Rob, can you hear me?
( 03:00 AM )

1365
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:19,856
David Breashears has a stash of oxygen
at the South Col that we can use.

1366
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:23,435
Alright, mate. Well, we're all organizing
a team, we're coming to get you.

1367
01:25:46,121 --> 01:25:48,095
Burning up.

1368
01:26:08,048 --> 01:26:09,806
No. No.

1369
01:26:10,867 --> 01:26:12,744
Yasuko.

1370
01:26:13,562 --> 01:26:15,528
Ohhh.

1371
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:17,385
Andy!

1372
01:26:23,949 --> 01:26:25,730
Come on!

1373
01:27:20,867 --> 01:27:24,021
Rob, talk to me, please. Pick up.
( Saturday, 11th May )

1374
01:27:28,432 --> 01:27:31,511
Pick up, mate. Please
( 05:00 AM )

1375
01:27:58,936 --> 01:28:00,694
Was there any word
from the others?

1376
01:28:00,727 --> 01:28:05,454
Anatoli managed to get 3 climbers back
from the South Col last night. But...

1377
01:28:05,479 --> 01:28:08,131
Beck and Yasuko
are still out there.

1378
01:28:08,163 --> 01:28:09,472
They're trying
to mount a search

1379
01:28:09,497 --> 01:28:12,394
but everyone who's been
up there is exhausted.

1380
01:28:14,425 --> 01:28:16,764
- Base.
- Rob, is that you?

1381
01:28:17,641 --> 01:28:20,615
Rob, where are you?
We're sending people for you.

1382
01:28:21,695 --> 01:28:23,751
Rob, this is Base Camp.

1383
01:28:27,779 --> 01:28:28,985
I can't.

1384
01:28:29,010 --> 01:28:32,655
Can't move anymore.
Can't move anymore.

1385
01:28:33,562 --> 01:28:35,389
Hey, mate. Yeah, I know.
I know, mate. I know.

1386
01:28:35,414 --> 01:28:37,501
You got to keep on moving.

1387
01:28:37,526 --> 01:28:39,261
Hands...

1388
01:28:39,286 --> 01:28:42,837
I can't feel my hands,
they're frozen.

1389
01:28:45,248 --> 01:28:47,893
There's "D" ice on the ice.

1390
01:28:47,918 --> 01:28:50,391
I got "D" ice in my mask.

1391
01:28:50,416 --> 01:28:52,963
That's good. You got to get
that mask working. You got to.

1392
01:28:52,988 --> 01:28:54,511
The sun's going to
come up and...

1393
01:28:54,536 --> 01:28:56,856
you know you can get warmer
and you can get moving.

1394
01:28:56,881 --> 01:28:58,905
- Guy.
- Yeah.

1395
01:28:58,930 --> 01:29:00,244
Guy.

1396
01:29:00,269 --> 01:29:02,969
Harold was here.
Where did he go?

1397
01:29:02,994 --> 01:29:05,554
Rob. Is Doug with you?

1398
01:29:09,074 --> 01:29:12,347
Doug. Doug's gone.

1399
01:29:14,038 --> 01:29:16,199
Harold is gone.

1400
01:29:19,173 --> 01:29:21,807
I'm going to need
a little help.

1401
01:29:22,834 --> 01:29:24,916
Okay.
Rob, you got to get yourself down.

1402
01:29:24,941 --> 01:29:26,597
Where are you?

1403
01:29:31,588 --> 01:29:33,314
Guy.

1404
01:29:33,339 --> 01:29:35,790
I'm in the... in the little...

1405
01:29:35,815 --> 01:29:39,044
in the little dip just below
the South Summit.

1406
01:29:39,299 --> 01:29:40,898
Alright, you can do this.

1407
01:29:40,923 --> 01:29:43,260
You just got to, you know,
pull yourself out of that dip,

1408
01:29:43,285 --> 01:29:45,500
and slide the rest of the way.

1409
01:29:45,525 --> 01:29:47,623
Guy, send them boys.

1410
01:29:47,648 --> 01:29:51,598
Okay. I'm going to
need a little help.

1411
01:29:51,623 --> 01:29:54,798
I got some Sheapas coming
up there with tea and oxygen.

1412
01:29:54,823 --> 01:29:56,708
You just got to
come on down, mate.

1413
01:29:56,733 --> 01:29:58,779
Aye, come on down.

1414
01:30:00,639 --> 01:30:02,150
Rob.

1415
01:30:06,729 --> 01:30:08,884
Can you patch Jan through?

1416
01:30:08,909 --> 01:30:11,576
- To Rob?
- Pat-Patch her through.

1417
01:30:11,601 --> 01:30:13,420
Let's-Let's just try it.
Let's just...

1418
01:30:13,445 --> 01:30:17,073
put the satphone next to the radio
and uh.

1419
01:30:17,098 --> 01:30:20,190
If anyone can motivate him
to move, and Jan will.

1420
01:30:21,333 --> 01:30:22,896
Guy to Rob.

1421
01:30:23,157 --> 01:30:24,780
Guy to Rob.

1422
01:30:27,431 --> 01:30:30,136
Guy to Rob. Can you read me?

1423
01:30:35,532 --> 01:30:37,981
- Rob, are you there?
- We're getting him now.

1424
01:30:40,336 --> 01:30:42,277
Rob, this is Helen.

1425
01:30:44,077 --> 01:30:45,695
Copy.

1426
01:30:45,902 --> 01:30:49,034
Rob, I got Jan for you.

1427
01:30:50,531 --> 01:30:52,285
My Jan?

1428
01:30:52,310 --> 01:30:53,640
Yeah. She's just here.

1429
01:30:53,665 --> 01:30:56,128
- Jan, you're on.
- Okay.

1430
01:30:56,788 --> 01:30:59,274
Hi, sweetheart.
How are you doing?

1431
01:31:02,590 --> 01:31:04,644
Hi, my love.

1432
01:31:04,669 --> 01:31:05,816
I'm a bit

1433
01:31:05,841 --> 01:31:07,985
a bit cold.

1434
01:31:08,246 --> 01:31:10,163
My love, I'm okay.

1435
01:31:10,188 --> 01:31:12,016
I know you are.

1436
01:31:12,041 --> 01:31:14,678
But the sun will warm you soon.

1437
01:31:15,069 --> 01:31:19,083
Sweetheart.
You got to get moving.

1438
01:31:19,246 --> 01:31:21,623
You got to come on down.

1439
01:31:22,446 --> 01:31:24,587
My hands...

1440
01:31:26,965 --> 01:31:28,759
frozen.

1441
01:31:30,045 --> 01:31:31,170
My...

1442
01:31:31,671 --> 01:31:34,290
My feet are frozen.

1443
01:31:34,695 --> 01:31:38,471
We're sending people up to you
with tea and "O" s.

1444
01:31:38,496 --> 01:31:41,772
But, you got to get moving, Rob.
Can you hear me?

1445
01:31:41,797 --> 01:31:44,396
You got to get
your circulation going.

1446
01:31:44,421 --> 01:31:46,527
Okay, my love.

1447
01:31:46,764 --> 01:31:50,269
You do it. Do it right now!

1448
01:31:52,404 --> 01:31:54,176
I love you.

1449
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:57,094
Over and out.

1450
01:32:06,693 --> 01:32:08,511
Come on, Rob.

1451
01:32:58,383 --> 01:33:00,603
We can't carry them.

1452
01:33:01,833 --> 01:33:03,931
That's not possible.

1453
01:33:04,048 --> 01:33:05,788
He's correct.

1454
01:33:06,986 --> 01:33:08,919
It's going to take "O"

1455
01:33:08,944 --> 01:33:11,206
just to get ourselves down.

1456
01:33:13,467 --> 01:33:15,517
Oh, damn it.

1457
01:33:19,798 --> 01:33:22,790
Helen, it's Mike here.
Do you copy?

1458
01:33:23,642 --> 01:33:25,437
Come in, Mike. What do you got?

1459
01:33:25,462 --> 01:33:28,268
Yasuko and Beck,

1460
01:33:28,293 --> 01:33:30,854
did not make it back to camp.

1461
01:33:35,294 --> 01:33:37,963
Okay, Mike.
Thanks for letting us know.

1462
01:33:49,779 --> 01:33:52,746
<font color=#ff8080>[NOT RETURNED]</font>
[SOUTH COL, CAMP 4]

1463
01:34:12,863 --> 01:34:14,370
Meg.

1464
01:34:16,944 --> 01:34:18,482
Bud.

1465
01:34:51,073 --> 01:34:53,426
Hello, Base Camp.
Hello, Base Camp.

1466
01:34:53,537 --> 01:34:55,268
Hello, Base Camp.

1467
01:34:56,110 --> 01:34:57,969
Ang Dorjee, this is Helen.

1468
01:34:57,994 --> 01:35:00,243
We have to turn back!

1469
01:35:00,268 --> 01:35:03,495
There is the very
bad storm again.

1470
01:35:04,246 --> 01:35:06,273
- Your call, Ang Dorjee.
- Sorry.

1471
01:35:06,298 --> 01:35:09,438
We'll try to do again,
when the storm pass.

1472
01:35:09,463 --> 01:35:11,644
We'll leave some tea
and oxygen here.

1473
01:35:11,669 --> 01:35:13,219
Sorry.

1474
01:35:19,805 --> 01:35:22,475
We have to tell Rob
they're not coming.

1475
01:35:23,621 --> 01:35:25,131
Okay.

1476
01:35:33,900 --> 01:35:35,222
Hey, Rob. It's Guy, mate.

1477
01:35:35,247 --> 01:35:36,844
Guy.

1478
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:42,397
I can't stop shaking, Guy.

1479
01:35:42,667 --> 01:35:45,581
The boys hit a bit of a high wind.
And...

1480
01:35:45,614 --> 01:35:48,592
your best shot is going
to be to get lower.

1481
01:35:51,488 --> 01:35:53,809
Let me think about it.

1482
01:35:55,740 --> 01:35:59,047
Don't think I can hang out
here another night.

1483
01:36:04,295 --> 01:36:06,920
We'll try again first thing, okay.

1484
01:37:15,425 --> 01:37:16,656
Helen?

1485
01:37:16,681 --> 01:37:18,060
Yeah.

1486
01:37:18,450 --> 01:37:20,594
Yeah, he's still there.

1487
01:37:21,586 --> 01:37:24,293
He's just below the South Summit.

1488
01:37:24,621 --> 01:37:27,334
He's got oxygen but...

1489
01:37:27,359 --> 01:37:29,310
it's iced up.

1490
01:37:29,335 --> 01:37:32,264
We don't know whether
he's been able to free it.

1491
01:37:34,707 --> 01:37:36,651
Is anybody with him?

1492
01:37:36,676 --> 01:37:38,196
No.

1493
01:37:38,616 --> 01:37:40,123
No.

1494
01:37:40,820 --> 01:37:44,218
You have to get him down before dark.
He won't survive another night.

1495
01:37:44,342 --> 01:37:45,960
We know.

1496
01:37:47,208 --> 01:37:50,880
But the storms come back,
real bad.

1497
01:37:51,314 --> 01:37:54,360
We can't get anyone
up to him tonight.

1498
01:37:54,385 --> 01:37:56,256
We tried.

1499
01:37:59,584 --> 01:38:02,028
He might as well
be on the moon.

1500
01:38:04,761 --> 01:38:06,003
Uh.

1501
01:38:07,951 --> 01:38:10,305
Can you put me on
with him again?

1502
01:38:10,330 --> 01:38:12,149
Of course.

1503
01:38:15,048 --> 01:38:17,740
Guy. Get Rob.

1504
01:38:21,601 --> 01:38:23,542
Hi, Rob. It's Guy.

1505
01:38:24,526 --> 01:38:26,685
I've got Jan for you.

1506
01:38:27,259 --> 01:38:28,723
Hold on.

1507
01:38:29,212 --> 01:38:31,054
Give me a second.

1508
01:38:45,530 --> 01:38:47,334
Okay.

1509
01:38:55,756 --> 01:38:58,051
Hi, sweetheart.

1510
01:38:58,706 --> 01:39:00,888
How are you?

1511
01:39:03,037 --> 01:39:05,561
I'm thinking about you.

1512
01:39:09,414 --> 01:39:11,406
Please say, "I'm good."

1513
01:39:13,617 --> 01:39:15,895
Are you warm, my love.

1514
01:39:16,569 --> 01:39:19,419
I might have a little frostbite.

1515
01:39:21,253 --> 01:39:24,439
I'm looking forward
to making it all better.

1516
01:39:27,135 --> 01:39:29,796
Can't wait for you
to come home.

1517
01:39:32,768 --> 01:39:34,903
How's Sarah?

1518
01:39:34,982 --> 01:39:36,707
Sarah?

1519
01:39:37,167 --> 01:39:39,193
Yeah.

1520
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:42,561
Yes, Sarah is good.

1521
01:39:44,059 --> 01:39:46,766
Will you call her that for me?

1522
01:39:47,043 --> 01:39:48,933
Yes, I will.

1523
01:39:51,515 --> 01:39:54,947
I don't think I'm going
to get to meet her.

1524
01:39:58,030 --> 01:40:00,689
I'm so sorry.

1525
01:40:04,757 --> 01:40:06,830
Don't say that.

1526
01:40:08,777 --> 01:40:11,527
If anyone can make it, you can.

1527
01:40:11,552 --> 01:40:13,191
Remember.

1528
01:40:16,858 --> 01:40:18,832
I love you.

1529
01:40:20,097 --> 01:40:23,343
Please don't worry too much.

1530
01:40:29,073 --> 01:40:31,716
Good bye, my love.

1531
01:40:44,819 --> 01:40:47,274
I love you, Rob.

1532
01:40:50,807 --> 01:40:52,749
I love you.

1533
01:42:35,369 --> 01:42:39,037
(Come on.) (Come on.)

1534
01:42:52,547 --> 01:42:54,865
(Come on, Dad.)

1535
01:44:16,489 --> 01:44:17,978
Beck.

1536
01:44:21,312 --> 01:44:23,521
Helen, it's Mike here.

1537
01:44:23,667 --> 01:44:25,888
Helen, do you copy?

1538
01:44:25,913 --> 01:44:27,714
Mike, come in.

1539
01:44:27,739 --> 01:44:29,563
Beck's still alive.

1540
01:44:29,588 --> 01:44:31,726
He walked himself into camp.

1541
01:44:34,221 --> 01:44:37,139
I got to get him down to Camp 1.

1542
01:44:38,504 --> 01:44:40,385
Thanks, Mike.

1543
01:44:44,042 --> 01:44:48,236
We don't even know how,
but he is alive.

1544
01:44:48,506 --> 01:44:50,151
The thing is, Peach,

1545
01:44:50,176 --> 01:44:51,927
we can't get him down the Icefall.

1546
01:44:51,952 --> 01:44:53,404
Oh no. I'll get him down.

1547
01:44:53,429 --> 01:44:55,622
- I'll get him down. Okay.
- Dad.

1548
01:44:55,647 --> 01:44:58,646
Okay, what do we need?
We need a helicopter, right?

1549
01:44:58,671 --> 01:45:03,858
Yeah, but they can't a helicopter up
that high because the air is too thin.

1550
01:45:03,883 --> 01:45:06,636
We should try, but it is
one heck of a rescue.

1551
01:45:06,661 --> 01:45:08,522
And he's not in a
good way, Peach. So...

1552
01:45:08,547 --> 01:45:11,476
I don't want you to get
your hopes up too high.

1553
01:45:16,312 --> 01:45:18,108
1 step at a time.

1554
01:45:21,338 --> 01:45:22,579
- You got to keep moving.
- I'm tired.

1555
01:45:22,604 --> 01:45:24,036
- I know.
- I'm tired.

1556
01:45:24,061 --> 01:45:26,473
I know you are.
I know you are. Come on.

1557
01:45:28,185 --> 01:45:30,075
Slow and steady.

1558
01:45:31,459 --> 01:45:33,584
Come on, keep moving.

1559
01:45:33,945 --> 01:45:38,544
Yes, I like the number of the
American Embassy in Kathmandu, Nepal.

1560
01:45:38,699 --> 01:45:39,931
Yes, Nepal.

1561
01:45:39,956 --> 01:45:42,566
Ambassador, please.
No. Sweets, I can't hold.

1562
01:45:42,591 --> 01:45:43,783
No. You listen, sir.

1563
01:45:43,808 --> 01:45:46,734
My husband has already died once
as you've seen on the news.

1564
01:45:46,759 --> 01:45:51,185
Trust me. Having him die a second
time is not going to play well on CNN.

1565
01:45:51,325 --> 01:45:53,731
There we go, buddy.

1566
01:45:54,211 --> 01:45:56,591
That's it, alright.

1567
01:45:57,422 --> 01:46:00,552
CAMP TWO

1568
01:46:01,237 --> 01:46:03,655
- Beck.
- Uh-huh.

1569
01:46:04,450 --> 01:46:05,582
How're you doing?

1570
01:46:05,607 --> 01:46:08,430
Oh, you know, third amendment.

1571
01:46:08,639 --> 01:46:10,079
Warming up?

1572
01:46:11,023 --> 01:46:13,000
I'm not sure yet.

1573
01:46:13,447 --> 01:46:15,666
Look like you are,
a little bit.

1574
01:46:17,892 --> 01:46:19,898
How's Rob doing?

1575
01:46:22,610 --> 01:46:25,329
Rob's still up there right now.

1576
01:46:27,507 --> 01:46:30,094
And Doug, what's he up to?

1577
01:46:34,640 --> 01:46:36,606
Doug's gone, Beck.

1578
01:46:52,539 --> 01:46:55,226
I don't know. No one's ever try
to fly higher than Base Camp before.

1579
01:46:55,251 --> 01:46:57,150
They gonna give it a go.

1580
01:46:57,175 --> 01:46:59,664
And find an LZ. Just mark up
with whatever you can.

1581
01:46:59,689 --> 01:47:01,339
Okay. Worth a try.

1582
01:47:01,378 --> 01:47:02,757
Thanks, Guy.

1583
01:47:02,784 --> 01:47:04,650
Grab a Gatorade.
Got a chopper coming in.

1584
01:47:04,675 --> 01:47:06,266
We need to make a LZ.

1585
01:47:06,291 --> 01:47:08,869
We got a chopper coming in!

1586
01:47:09,524 --> 01:47:12,092
- Clear the rope back to the tents!
- Okay.

1587
01:47:12,117 --> 01:47:13,178
Thanks.

1588
01:47:13,203 --> 01:47:15,793
Keep it clear.
Keep this whole area clear.

1589
01:47:16,438 --> 01:47:18,078
Come on. Come on.

1590
01:47:25,159 --> 01:47:27,268
We're doing fine.

1591
01:47:32,969 --> 01:47:35,043
It's not possible.

1592
01:47:35,416 --> 01:47:38,103
You land here,
we'll never get back up.

1593
01:47:44,333 --> 01:47:46,631
Okay, Major, let's go back.

1594
01:48:05,107 --> 01:48:07,338
- That's it.
- Can't get any more out.

1595
01:48:07,363 --> 01:48:09,529
It's as light as
we're going to get it.

1596
01:48:10,636 --> 01:48:13,397
- Tango to Charlie.
- Tango to Charlie.

1597
01:48:24,326 --> 01:48:26,640
Right here! Right here!

1598
01:48:28,757 --> 01:48:31,277
Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

1599
01:48:59,521 --> 01:49:00,890
Come on, Beck.

1600
01:49:00,915 --> 01:49:02,456
Nearly there.

1601
01:49:05,333 --> 01:49:07,095
Okay. Come on.

1602
01:49:09,696 --> 01:49:10,868
1 person.

1603
01:49:10,893 --> 01:49:13,639
- Only 1 person.
- Just him, just 1.

1604
01:49:13,664 --> 01:49:16,228
- Alright.
- There you go.

1605
01:49:19,496 --> 01:49:20,946
You good?

1606
01:49:21,275 --> 01:49:24,447
I'm going to lift the tail up.
Fly us over the edge.

1607
01:49:26,765 --> 01:49:29,149
- Is that okay with you?
- I'm with you.

1608
01:49:29,174 --> 01:49:30,969
Good, man.

1609
01:50:49,795 --> 01:50:52,270
Get yourself inside, go on.

1610
01:50:55,747 --> 01:50:57,888
It's alright, Anatoli.

1611
01:51:03,488 --> 01:51:05,886
I'm so sorry, Helen.

1612
01:51:06,402 --> 01:51:08,770
Come on. Let's get you inside.

1613
01:51:30,488 --> 01:51:32,292
Hi, Peachy.

1614
01:51:36,819 --> 01:51:38,249
Beck.

1615
01:51:51,005 --> 01:51:53,406
Thank you so much, darling.

1616
01:52:13,790 --> 01:52:16,137
Oh, Jan. I'm so sorry.

1617
01:52:44,648 --> 01:52:52,648
Rob's body remains on the mountain
alongside the others who lost their lives.

1618
01:52:55,113 --> 01:52:59,853
Scott Fischer

1619
01:53:01,496 --> 01:53:06,339
Andy 'Harold' Harris

1620
01:53:07,720 --> 01:53:12,674
Doug Hansen.

1621
01:53:14,255 --> 01:53:19,113
Yasuko Namba.

1622
01:53:20,139 --> 01:53:27,666
Adventure Consultants Team 1996

1623
01:53:29,481 --> 01:53:35,112
Beck Weathers lost both hands and his nose.

1624
01:53:36,574 --> 01:53:41,410
He still lives in Dallas
with his wife, Peach.

1625
01:53:42,689 --> 01:53:48,418
In July 1996, Jan gave
birth to a baby girl.

1626
01:53:49,875 --> 01:53:55,610
She named her Sarah.

1627
01:53:59,804 --> 01:54:05,608
Sarah Arnold-Hall.
